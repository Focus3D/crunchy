#summary How to use MoinMoin with Crunchy.

= Using MoinMoin with Crunchy =

One exciting Crunchy forthcoming development is the integration with a Python-based wiki (MoinMoin) allowing collaborative work for Crunchy-aware tutorials.  Until this project is completed, you will have to install MoinMoin to experiment with this idea.

==Instructions==

Go to [http://moinmo.in/DesktopEdition the MoinMoin Desktop Edition page] and follow the instructions.  In particular, start MoinMoin (moin.py) locally.

Start Crunchy and go to the Browsing menu page.  Enter http://127.0.0.1:8080 as the URL for a remote tutorial and load it.  You may want to select *crunchy.no_markup = 'interpreter'* using an interpreter prompt before loading this page.

That's it.
