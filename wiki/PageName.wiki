=What should be in Crunchy Core/Plugins=
This is inspired by the idea of allowing WebLab (http://www.physics.ox.ac.uk/users/santoso/Software.WebLab.html) to use the Crunchy core.

==Definitely Core==

    * Execution of Python and IO
    * Extensible HTTP Server
    * Translation
    * Security (at least the part to do with tokens - however they are implemented)


==Definitely Plugins==

    * All of VLAM
    * Doctests, etc...


==Ambiguous (w. arguments)==
===VLAM Parsing===
I consider this ambiguous because it is specific to Crunchy.
