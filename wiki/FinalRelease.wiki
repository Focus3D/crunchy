= Towards 1.0 release =

In preparation for the final 1.0 release, the following must be completed.

==Issues==

Resolve all relevant issues - all remaining open issues must have been tagged as being "beyond 1.0".

====Useful lists of Issues====
  * Open Release 1.0 issues: http://code.google.com/p/crunchy/issues/list?q=label%3AMilestone-Release1.0&can=2
  * Release 1.0 issues that need verification: http://code.google.com/p/crunchy/issues/list?can=7&q=label%3AMilestone-Release1.0&colspec=ID+Type+Status+Priority+Milestone+Owner+Summary&cells=tiles

Both of those lists should be empty.

==Appearance==

Crunchy's "look" must have been finalized, with everyone (well... at least both Johannes
and André) agreeing about all styling issues.

  * Note: must determine if some visual symbol has to be re-introduced to indicate the security level on the page (or on the menu?).

==Testing==

Ensure that Crunchy has been tested under
  # At least one Linux flavor
  # Windows
  # Windows with path for user containing non-ascii character (André!)
  # Mac OS

"Tested" means that Crunchy must have been run by a user, that all existing unit tests
have been executed as well as all the existing functional tests (using selenium).
This should be noted below, including the platform and the user.


==Content==

All html pages directly assessible from the left-hand-side menu must have been determined 
to be completed.  Each of these should be noted below, indicating the page name and the
user who performed the official check.  *Note: this should be the very last thing done prior to a release, to ensure that the information is up to date and reflect all the changes made.  Do not update the table until then.*  A _bug fix_ release could be done without this QA check being made.

Ensure that documentation is complete: for example, there is a simple turtle module included in the Crunchy distribution that should be documented.

==Open issues==

  * Should "Tests" on the left-hand side menu be renamed "Miscelleaneous"?
  * Should we remove all styling "hard-coded" information in .py files, like what was done when addressing issue 112, prior to the 1.0 release?
