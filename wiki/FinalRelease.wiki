= Towards 1.0 release =

In preparation for the final 1.0 release, the following must be completed.

==Issues==

Resolve all relevant issues - all remaining open issues must have been tagged as being "beyond 1.0".

==Appearance==

Crunchy's "look" must have been finalized, with everyone (well... at least both Johannes
and André) agreeing about all styling issues.

  * Note: must determine if some visual symbol has to be re-introduced to indicate the
security level on the page (or on the menu?).

==Testing==

Ensure that Crunchy has been tested under
  # At least one Linux flavor
  # Windows
  # Windows with path for user containing non-ascii character (André!)
  # Mac OS

"Tested" means that Crunchy must have been run by a user, that all existing unit tests
have been executed as well as all the existing functional tests (using selenium).
This should be noted below, including the platform and the user.


==Content==

All html pages directly assessible from the left-hand-side menu must have been determined 
to be completed.  Each of these should be noted below, indicating the page name and the
user who performed the official check.

==Open issues==

Question: should "Tests" on the left-hand side menu be renamed "Miscelleaneous"?
