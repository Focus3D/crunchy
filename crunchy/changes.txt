- rst_edit plugin (live html previewer of processed reStructuredText)


Version 1.1
------------
- New program: crst2s5.py.  Based on rst2s5, creates slide shows from rst files.
  * includes two new directives:
        - getpythonsource (based on the inspect module)
        - crunchy (to insert crunchy specific markup)
        - based on S5 v1.2a (as opposed to v1.1 for rst2s5)
- new slideshow plugin
  * automatically detects which version (1.1 or 1.2) of S5 is used
  (if information present)
  * automatically save/remove/restore the custom markup user preference
    so that they don't interfere with the slideshow
- added possibility to use templates with reStructuredText files.
- fixed a bug where the class(es) for <pre> included by tutorial writer
  were dropped.
- simplified greatly crunchy specific rst directives (issue 232)
- fixed a bug (issue 233) where default python_tutorial using rst did not
  result in an interpreter being inserted.
- fixed a bug where @import and url() instructions inside css files loaded
  locally were ignored - as they can, in general, create security holes.
  However, it is now assumed that they are safe if loaded locally.  Tutorial
  loaded from remote site designated as "trusted" were already working
  properly.

Version 1.0.1
--------------

- new experimental "get source" plugin.  Works with html and
   reStructuredText files.
- fixed bug: exception raised when attempting to load a local html file
   (issue 230, r1345)
- fixed bug: exception raised when attempting to close a filehandle
    while loading a python file (issue 229, r1344)
- fixed an incorrect button label for Loading html tutorials (r1342)
- fixed a bug when linenumbering was used - the last line of code was
  not numbered. (r1348)
