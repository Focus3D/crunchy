<div id="main_title">How does Crunchy perform its magic?</div>
<div id='content'>
<p>In case you are wondering, we will explain graphically how Crunchy performs it magic.
There are four parts to consider.</p>
<li>The User starts Crunchy and communication is established.</li>
<li>Crunchy sanitizes the html pages requested to remove unwanted elements.</li>
<li>Crunchy processes the markup (vlam) to insert appropriate interactive elements.</li>
<li>The User requests that some Python code be executed</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: all images have been produced using

<h3>Starting Crunchy and User Authentication</h3>
<p>Explain how we start Crunchy, etc.</p>

<p>Draw attention to the "retrieve and process file" box.  Explain that this
consists of two step: a sanitizing/filtering step, and the processing of markup.</p>
<h3>Security: Filtering Unwanted Elements</h3>
<p>Perhaps add a word about three (or six) security levels</p>
