This is a demonstration of a presentation made using Crunchy
and a pre-alpha release version of crst2s5.

Why is it called crst2s5?
================================

.. class:: incremental

* S5: Simple Standards-based Slide Show System

.. container:: notes

   S5 was created by Eric Meyer.  It consists in a series of style files
   and some javascript code to transform an html file into a slide
   show.

.. class:: incremental

* rst: reStructuredText

.. class:: incremental

* rst2s5.py: docutils script used to transform a reStructured text document into an S5 html file.

  .. class:: incremental

  * based on S5 version 1.1

.. class:: incremental

* crst2s5.py: similar to rst2s5.py

  .. class:: incremental

  * based on a customized version of S5 version 1.2a

  * version 1.2a includes speaker notes & timer

  .. container:: notes

    Show some speaker notes.

  .. class:: incremental

  * crst2s5.py includes some custom directives

  * automatic font scaling disabled, etc.

.. class:: incremental

* Crunchy + crst2s5.py == Interactive Presentations

  .. class:: incremental

  * :huge:`Interactive?`


Interactive element: interpreter
================================

.. crunchy:: interpreter

   >>> for i in range(20):
   ...     print i

Interactive element: editor
================================

.. crunchy:: editor

   >>> for i in range(20):
   ...     print i


Custom directives
=====================


* New directive::

    .. crunchy:: Very Little Added Markup (or vlam)

.. container:: notes

   This is what enables the embedding of interactive elements with Crunchy

* New directive::

    .. getpythonsource:: path/to/file/module.object

.. container:: notes

   Uses Python's inspect module to get insert the relevant source code.

getpythonsource tests (1)
===========================

The following automatically import the module a_test_file.  When the generated
html file is viewed with Crunchy the code will be styled and line numbers will
be added.::

    .. getpythonsource:: a_test_file python linenumber

.. getpythonsource:: a_test_file python linenumber


getpythonsource tests (2)
===========================
Importing the function "print_squares", with linenumbers and with
an editor embedded.

.. getpythonsource:: a_test_file.print_squares editor linenumber

getpythonsource tests (3)
===========================

Now, just importing the method "bye", with a Python interpreter.

.. getpythonsource:: a_test_file.Fantastic.bye interpreter


getpythonsource tests (4)
===========================

Finally, if the desired object can not be imported, a traceback is produced
instead.::

   .. getpythonsource:: a_test_file.does_not_exist python

.. getpythonsource:: a_test_file.does_not_exist python

Note that we added "python" at the end to tell Crunchy that we expected
a Python source code and to style it (using pygments) appropriately.


To do
============

* Note: if you are using Firefox on a Mac to do presentations,
  get the `Full Fullscreen`__ add-on

  __ https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1568


* explain what to copy and where
* explain how to use crst2s5.py

* explain how to use html files produced by crst2s5.py

  - by themselves
  - with Crunchy

* fix slides.js (v1.2a) for Crunchy

crunchy directives (1)
===========================

Just a basic Python program:

.. crunchy:: python

   print "Hello world!"

And the Python 3 version:

.. crunchy:: python3 linenumber

   print("Hello world!")

crunchy directives (2)
===========================

Time for including an interpreter:

.. crunchy:: interpreter

   print "Hello world!"


crunchy directives (3)
===========================

This time, we include an editor:

.. crunchy:: editor linenumber

   print "Hello world!"

crunchy directives (4)
===========================

Finally, how about some html code:

.. crunchy:: html

   <pre>
   print "Hello world!"
   </pre>

How was this made?
==================

* This presentation was produced by the following command at a terminal prompt:

  python crst2s5.py --theme=ui/showmedo --theme-url=ui/showmedo showmedo_demo.txt showmedo_demo.html

* Note: if using a dark theme (say, with a black background), select the
  appropriate pygments theme in Crunchy's preferences.
