crst2s5 How To
=================================

:Authors: Andr√© Roberge
:Date:    circa september 2009

This document is meant as a foolproof step by step way of using crst2s5.py
and is written in parallel with the development of :green:`crst2s5.py`.

Things may appear :tiny:`... ok, they are` more complicated than they should be
at this point but it will get better as time goes on.

.. This is an example of writing an html comment; and so is the next one:
.. This document has been placed in the public domain.

.. container:: notes

   Ok, this is a sample speaker note.  This can appear in a secondary window.
   With the defaults currently chosen for print.css, the speakers notes will
   not appear if the presentation is printed - but they are visible in the
   outline view in the browser.

.. container:: handout

   And this is a sample text included in the outline view but which does not
   appear in either the speaker notes nor on the slide.

Introduction
============

.. class:: handout

   crst2s5 is based on Docutils_/reStructuredText_ and S5_.

.. _Docutils: http://docutils.sourceforge.net/
.. _reStructuredText: http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html
.. _S5: http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/s5/

.. container:: notes

   Showing off some speaker notes: this one was entered via the
   ``.. container:: notes`` directive...

   .. class:: notes

  ... Whereas this note was entered via the ``.. class:: notes`` directive.

.. topic:: Installation
   :class: handout

   Prerequisites: Python and the Docutils_ package have to be
   installed.  See the `Docutils README`__ file for installation
   instructions.

   __ http://docutils.sourceforge.net/README.html

* This presentation was produced by the following command at a terminal prompt:

  -python ../crunchy/crst2s5.py --theme=ui/pycon_light --theme-url=ui/pycon_light how_to.txt how_to.html

  .. class:: handout

  how_to.txt used normal reStructuredText.




To do
============

* Note: if you are using Firefox on a Mac to do presentations,
  get the `Full Fullscreen`__ add-on

  __ https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1568


* explain what to copy and where
* explain how to use crst2s5.py

* explain how to use html files produced by crst2s5.py

  - by themselves
  - with Crunchy

* fix slides.js (v1.2a) for Crunchy
* add choice in slideshow.py for 1.1 vs 1.2


To do (cont'd)
===============

* create pycon_dark style
* add special crunchy directives
* add to crunchy an automatic option that change user preferences so that they
  don't cause trouble, and restore them automatically

  * this includes a check for pycon_dark style.

* fix url inside local css files.

* END -----

crunchy directives (1)
===========================

Just a basic Python program:

.. crunchy:: python

   print "Hello world!"

And the Python 3 version:

.. crunchy:: python3 linenumber

   print("Hello world!")

crunchy directives (2)
===========================

Time for including an interpreter:

.. crunchy:: interpreter

   print "Hello world!"


crunchy directives (3)
===========================

This time, we include an editor:

.. crunchy:: editor linenumber

   print "Hello world!"

crunchy directives (4)
===========================

Finally, how about some html code:

.. crunchy:: html

   <pre title="python">
   print "Hello world!"
   </pre>


getpythonsource tests (1)
===========================

The following automatically import the module a_test_file, style it, and
adds line numbers.

.. crunchy:: getsource a_test_file linenumber

getpythonsource tests (2)
===========================

Now, just importing the method "bye", still adding line numbers ...
and an editor.

.. getpythonsource:: a_test_file.Fantastic.bye linenumber editor

getpythonsource tests (3)
===========================
Finally, importing the function "a_function", with no linenumbers but with
an interpreter embedded.

.. getpythonsource:: a_test_file.a_function interpreter
