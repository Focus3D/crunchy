<h3>A Potted Crunchy History</h3>

<blockquote><i> ... If I may begin at the beginning. First there is the <font color="red">cherry</font> fondue. This is extremely nasty, but we can't prosecute you for that...</i><br />
<small>From the Monty Python Crunchy Frog sketch. </small></blockquote>

<p>In the beginning, there was <tt>IT</tt>.  
The original idea for <tt>IT</tt> had been simmering in Andr&eacute;'s mind for
a few years. The first implementation was inspired by an REPL (read-eval-print-loop) 
implemented by <b>Robert Brewer</b> using 
<a href="http://www.cherrypy.org/" title="external_link">
<span style="color:red">CherryPy</span></a>.

<tt>IT</tt> was <em>nice</em> and <tt>IT</tt> was the name suggested by Andr&eacute; Roberge's 13 year old daughter Evelyne after he showed her and explained to her that <tt>IT</tt> was designed to produce <tt>I</tt>nteractive Python <tt>T</tt>utorials.
However, <tt>IT</tt> was found to be slightly uninspiring as a name.  After asking on 
the edu-sig list for potential names, <tt>IT</tt> became Crunchy Frog. </p>
<p>
Crunchy Frog (it probably was more of a Tadpole back then) grew slowly
until Johannes Woolard joined as a developer, thanks to Google's financial support 
during the Summer of Code 2006.  
As the Frog matured and another project was found with the same name, 
natural selection took its course and, as of version 0.7, 
this project was renamed "Crunchy".</p>
<p>Since then, much development has occurred, many people have contributed code, and Crunchy
has grown, even spanning a new project: 
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/croquant/" title="external_link">Croquant</a>, 
which means crunchy in French.</p>
