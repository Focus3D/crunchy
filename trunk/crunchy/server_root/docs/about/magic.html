<div id="main_title">How does Crunchy perform its magic?</div>
<div id='content'>
<p>In case you are wondering, we will explain graphically how Crunchy performs it magic.
There are four parts to consider.</p>
<li>The User starts Crunchy and communication is established.</li>
<li>Crunchy sanitizes the html pages requested to remove unwanted elements.</li>
<li>Crunchy processes the markup (vlam) to insert appropriate interactive elements.</li>
<li>The User requests that some Python code be executed</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: all images have been produced using 
<a href="http://www.websequencediagrams.com/" title="external_link">a wonderful free tool.</a>
</p>
<h3>Starting Crunchy and User Authentication</h3>
<p>Explain how we start Crunchy, etc.</p>
<img src="/images/authenticate1.png">
<p>Future authentication requests are done using the stored information, without
requesting any information from the user, as long as the browser session
is active.</p>

<div class="notes" style="width:200px">
<h4>Getting deeper</h4>
<p>
Most of the work done by Crunchy is hidden in the
step indicated by "Retrieves and process file"
on the diagram to the left.

<h4 >Is it safe to browse a web site with Crunchy?</h4>
<div class="wide-warning">
<h4>We are serious about safety</h4>
<p>While we try to be humorous in Crunchy's documentation, security is not
a laughing matter.  We believe it is important that we provide you with a full
description of how Crunchy deals with security matters.
Feel free to contact us directly if you have any questions or suggestions
concerning security.</p>
</div>

<p>
We begin with an overview explaining how Crunchy work.  
Assume Crunchy is running and that the user click on a link 
(or similar method) to go to a new page.
</p>
<ol>
<li>Crunchy retrieves the page.</li>
<li>Crunchy parses the page to create a tree structure 
(using Elementtree - more on this later).</li>
<li>Crunchy removes any existing javascript, links to javascript files
and various undesired html tags.</li>
<li>Crunchy processes the Crunchy specific markup (vlam), adding
custom elements <b><em>and</em></b> custom javascript.</li>
<li>Crunchy feeds the page to the browser, leaving a line of
communication open, waiting for user instruction.</li>
</ol>
<p>
We will address the various points in reverse order.
At step 5, Crunchy is simply waiting for the user's instruction, and will
not execute any code on the page unless the user takes some active steps,
like clicking on a button or typing some code and pressing the "enter" key
to send it to an interpreter.
<em>If the user types in the appropriate Python code to delete all files
on the computer ...</em> Crunchy will dutifully execute that code.  There is
nothing we can do about this.  The same thing could happen if a user
started a normal Python shell and typed in the same code.  So, at step 5,
it is <em>user beware</em>!
</p>
<h3>User Beware: Running Arbitrary Python Code</h3>
<img src="/images/run_python.png">

<p>
At step 4, Crunchy inserts the required javascript code to enable 
communication between the browser and the Python interpreter. 
On its own, this step is harmless.
</p>
<p>
At step 3, Crunchy removes any pre-existing javascript code, etc.
<em>What if Crunchy fails in removing the existing javascript code?</em>
And, <em>what if the existing javascript code is designed to 
identify a Crunchy specific javascript function on the page and uses it 
to send some malicious Python code to the interpreter?</em>.
</p>
<div class="notes">
<h4>Quote from feedparser.org</h4>
<p>
Our white list consists of a series of html tags, each with their own set of attributes,
that are allowed on the page.  For example, &lt;a&gt; is allowed, but &lt;applet&gt; is not.

Here is an incomplete list of potentially dangerous <acronym >HTML</acronym> tags and 
attributes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<tt>script</tt>, which can contain malicious script</li>
<li>
<tt>applet</tt>, <tt>embed</tt>, and <tt>object</tt>, which can automatically download and 
execute malicious code</li>

<li>
<tt>meta</tt>, which can contain malicious redirects</li>
<li>
<tt>onload</tt>, <tt>onunload</tt>, and all other <tt>on*</tt> attributes, 
which can contain malicious script</li>
<li>
<tt>style</tt>, <tt>link</tt>, and the <tt>style</tt> attribute, which can contain 
malicious script</li>

</ul>
<p><em><tt>style</tt>?</em>
Yes, <tt>style</tt>.  
<acronym>CSS</acronym> 
definitions can contain executable code.
</p>
</div>

<p>If something like this were to happen ... it would be disastrous.  
Therefore, we must be very careful in identifying and removing potentially
harmful content.  The method
we use is based on the existence of a <em>white list</em> that we created.
Before we proceed with a more detailed explanation, you might want
to read 
<a title="external_link" href="http://feedparser.org/docs/html-sanitization.html">this</a>
document from feedparser.org.  You may also want to do an Internet search for
<em>cross site scripting</em> (XSS), which is a topic closely related to the
problem we are trying to address.  Once you understand XSS, you might want to 
have also a look at 
<a title="external_link" href="http://ha.ckers.org/xss.html">http://ha.ckers.org/xss.html</a>.
</p>

<p>The white list we have created is different from the one at feedparser.org.
Actually, we have 3 different white lists, for 3 different levels of security.
They are: <em>strict</em>, <em>normal</em> and <em>trusted</em>.
</p>

<dl>
<dt><b>strict</b></dt>
<dd>With the strict level (previously named <em>paranoid</em>), 
the following html tags are not included
in our white list: applet, basefont, base, button, form, frameset,
iframe, input, isindex, object, optgroup, option, param, script,
select and textarea - as well as link, style and img.
Not all excluded tags are potentially harmful; some are simply
deprecated.<br/>
For the included tags, only the <em>title</em> attribute is allowed, except
for the &lt;a&gt; tag, for which we allow <em>id</em> and <em>href</em>
as attributes and the &lt;meta&gt; for which we allow the <em>name</em> attribute which can
be used in conjunction with the <em>title</em> attribute to add a relative path to 
<code>sys.path</code> so that examples using <code title="py_code">import</code>
can be used.  If they don't contain Crunchy objects, pages displayed
with the strict level selected are essentially the same as old-fashioned html
text only documents.</dd>
<dt><b>normal</b></dt>
<dd>At the normal level, we allow &lt;link&gt; and &lt;style&gt;, as well as the style 
attribute.  However, we scan either the file being linked or the content 
inside the &lt;style&gt; tag, or style attribute
for either the string "url("  [with possible spaces before the parenthese]
and any string starting with "&amp;#" which often would denote an obfuscated character 
meant to bypass normal filters [see the 
<a title="external_link" href="http://feedparser.org/docs/html-sanitization.html">feedparser.org</a>
and 
<a title="external_link" href="http://ha.ckers.org/xss.html">http://ha.ckers.org/xss.html</a>
links already mentioned for an explanation].  We treat such content as automatically
suspicious and remove automatically these tags entirely when such content is met.<br/>
We also allow the <em>content</em> attribute for the meta tag which is used by Crunchy 
to allow a tutorial writer to design an alternate menu for Crunchy; we also allow the 
<em>http-equiv</em> only together with the value <em>content-type</em>.
Finally, we allow the img tag; however, we pre-scan each image
to make sure that it is indeed an image file and not some cleverly disguised javascript
code.  <em><b>Unfortunately</b></em>, as a result, it can take quite a while to load
a page containing many external images.  However, we normally need to verify the
validity of a given image only once per Crunchy session.<br/>
The normal level is currently the default level used when starting Crunchy.  
With this level, you can browse the official Python tutorial and it will look
just the same <small>[better, actually! ... at least for versions prior to 2.6]</small> 
as if you viewed it
directly in your browser without Crunchy's help.  However, a site like python.org
will look very different, as most styling will be removed.</dd>
<dt><b>trusted</b></dt>
<dd>Finally, at the trusted level, we allow the same content as with the normal level,
except that we don't scan for suspicious styling information and assume that all images
are safe.  Using the trusted level, a site like python.org will look almost identical as 
intended when viewed through Crunchy.<br/>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>In addition to the above described steps, we do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>We transform all links of the form <code>href="url?query"</code> into <code>href="url"</code>.
This is to prevent accidental communication between the webbrowser and the Python server, sending a
"query" to the latter.</li>
<li>All instructions sent to the Python server in order of having some Python command executed
take the form <code>/command_RANDOM_ID?query</code> where <code>RANDOM_ID</code> is an 18 digit long 
random integer generated at the beginning of a session.  This way, even if a malicious query bypassed
the cleanup mentioned at the previous step, it would still be nearly impossible to guess the
commands required for the Python interpreter to execute some malicious code sent by a query; some
javascript code specifically designed to scan the page and extract this session-specific random 
integer would have had to be inserted on that page.
</li>
</ul>
<p>The first two security levels mentioned [strict and normal] should be
totally safe against unwanted javascript intrusion.  The third one, as its name
indicates, should only be used with trusted sites - and only if it is found that
it is required for appropriate formatting.
</p>

<p>The possibility of using obfuscated code (e.g. using "&amp;#..." entities) is one that
can cause problems for many filters [see the two links already mentioned].  
However, as far as we have been able to verify, 
Crunchy is immune to this problem due to the way it parses
html pages according to step 2 mentioned previously:
Crunchy uses a combination of BeautifulSoup and Elementtree  (i.e. ElementSoup)
to parse pages.  BeautifulSoup is known to handled ill-formed web pages, parsing them
and transforming them into well-formed ones.  Elementtree takes well-formed
web pages, and create a tree structure representing them. If a page is not well-formed,
Elementtree will raise an exception and Crunchy will not be able to
proceed with that page.
By using this combination of BeautifulSoup and Elementtree,
we are left with a well defined tree that can be trimmed as mentioned above, hopefully removing
any potential problems.
</p>
<h4>How can one determine which security level to use?</h4>
<p>At this point you might wonder how you could afford to select a security level
other than 'strict' to view pages from a new site.  What you look at a page found on the web using
a less stringent level, and something nasty sneaks in? By the time you look at it, it might
already be too late...</p>

<p>The solution to this problem is the introduction of 3 additional security levels.  They are:
</p>
<ul>
<li>display strict</li>
<li>display normal</li>
<li>display trusted</li>
</ul>
<p>
Using each of these levels, Crunchy parses the page as you would expect according to
the above descriptions.  The difference is that step 4 <small>[where Crunchy
inserts custom javascript code and enables communication between the
browser and the Python interpreter]</small> does not take place.  Crunchy simply
displays the page so that it looks almost like it would normally, but no Python code execution
is possible.  A user can select a 'display' mode, inspect the page content to verify that
no foreign javascript is included, before loading it normally.</p>
<p>To help you, whenever some tags or attributes are removed from a page, Crunchy inserts a link
at the top of the page giving you some summary of what it actually removed.</p>
<h4>How do I select a security level?</h4>





<p>Draw attention to the "retrieve and process file" box.  Explain that this
consists of two step: a sanitizing/filtering step, and the processing of markup.</p>
