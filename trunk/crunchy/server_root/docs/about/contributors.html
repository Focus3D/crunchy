<h3 >Who contributed to Crunchy?</h3>
<p>
Many people, each in their different ways, have contributed, either directly or indirectly,
to Crunchy.  We try to keep track of you all ... but if we forgot your name, please send us
a reminder.
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Andr&eacute; Roberge</b> had the original idea for Crunchy, and is the
lead developer.</li>
<li><b>Johannes Woolard</b> started to work on Crunchy as a Google Summer of Code student in 2006,
and quickly assumed the role of co-developer. Johannes' contributions to Crunchy are
too numerous to mention.  Without his work, it is unlikely that Crunchy would have been
more than a proof-of-concept demonstration application.</li>
<li>Crunchy's name is the result of a suggestion by <b>Dethe Elza</b> on the edu-sig list.</li>
<li><b>Hao Lian</b>, as part of his work during Google's Summer of Code 2009, completed a port
of Crunchy to Python 3.1 and, in the process, created some useful tools for developers
and simplified some existing code.  Andr&eacute; used Hao's work to start implementing a
"hybrid" version of Crunchy that works with Python 2.4+ and Python 3.1; this
was completed prior to the 1.0 release with the help of Hao.</li>
<li><b>Tao Fei</b>, as part of his work during Google's Summer of Code 2008, implemented
the authentication (username and password) security feature, wrote the first protototype of
the account manager, the debugger plugin, an "exam mode" prototype
and fixed various bugs along the way.</li>
<li><b>Florian Bir&eacute;e</b>, as part of his work during Google's Summer of Code 2008,
wrote <a href="http://code.google.com/p/croquant/" title="external_link">Croquant</a>,
a <a href="http://moinmo.in/" title="external_link">MoinMoin</a> plugin which allows
tutorial writers to embed VLAM inside wikis, making them potentially very useful
for collaborative tutorial writers.  Florian also implemented the first prototype
of all three code analyzers (code quality) plugins, extended the number of terminals supported
(Linux flavours) for launching external programs, implemented a unit test plugin
(similar to the doctest one) and made other smaller contributions.
</li>
<li><b>Bryan Psymas</b> worked on Crunchy as a Google Summer of Code student in 2007.  He
was the main driving force behind the security advisor feature.</li>
<li><b>Edin Salkovic</b> worked briefly on Crunchy during Google's Summer of Code 2007; he
implemented the prototype for an image file plugin which has since been
abandoned given the much greater flexibility of the dhtml module.</li>
<li><b>Jason Walsh</b>, who was not sponsored by anyone, just out of his own
interest, wrote a prototype plugin enabling the use of
<a href="www.pygments.org" title="external_link">Pygments</a>.</li>
<li><b>Nic Freeman</b> did the images (blue line drawings) that were displayed on the
right hand side at the top of the original Crunchy tutorial pages.  While we no longer
use these images, they contributed to giving a friendly face to the original Crunchy.</li>
<li>As part of Google's Highly Open Participation contest 2007, many students contributed to Crunchy.  They are:
 <ul>
 <li><b>Josip Dzolonga</b> for the Macedonian translation, for the unit tests for
 vlam_local.py and vlam_remote.py and for suggesting to change the code so that
 test files and available translations are automatically found - without needing
 to edit existing .py files.</li>
 <li><b>Mario Garza</b> for the Spanish translation.</li>
 <li><b>Tanel Liiv</b> for the Estonian translation. (This translation was further improved
 by contributions [outside of GHOP] from <b>Raul Laansoo</b> and <b>Pearu Peterson</b>.)</li>
 <li><b>Zachary Voase</b> for improving the test coverage of utilities.py, suggesting
 a simplification of the existing Crunchy code and implementing Crunchy-specific
 reStructuredText directives.</li>
  <li><b>David Marek</b> for creating a reStructuredText plugin and finding a genuine
 Crunchy bug.</li>
 <li><b>Michele Mazzoni</b> for creating the first complete prototype for launching
 an external program using a different version of the Python interpreter; this allows,
 for example, to use Crunchy running under Python 2.5 to launch programs executed with
 Python 3.0.</li>
 <li><b>Felipe Schneider</b> for the Brazilian Portuguese translation.</li>
 <li><b>Sven Braun</b> for the German translation.</li>
 <li><b>Stipkovits &Aacute;dam</b> for the Hungarian translation.</li>
 <li><b>Gianluca Varisco</b> for the Italian translation </li>
 <li><b>Mateusz Tybura</b> for the Polish translation.</li>
 </ul>
<li><b>Note that the translations have not been kept of to date as of version 1.0.
Hopefully this will be addressed post 1.0.</b></li>
</li>
