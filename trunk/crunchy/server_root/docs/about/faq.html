<p>Crunchy does not have bugs! 
We do recognize that it does have a few interesting <em>features</em>; however, you should
not confuse those with actual <em><b>bugs</b></em>.</p>
<h3 >If you do have some questions...</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="#secure">If it safe to browse a web site with Crunchy?</a> 
</li>

<li>
<a href="#w3c">The external page I view with Crunchy is all messed up as compared with viewing
it directly with my browser.</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="#colours">Crunchy's logo and the choice of colours look very much like
Python's.  Can you really do this?</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="#crunchy_ready">My blog or tutorial shows up very well using Crunchy; 
should I do anything special?</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="#my_own_style">I have written a tutorial with my own style and I would like
for Crunchy not to modify it; why can't I?</a>
</li>

<li>
<a href="#disappearing_cursor">The cursor (caret) sometimes does not show up in an editor or
textarea.  Surely, this is a Crunchy bug.</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="#selenium">When I enable an editor, the syntax coloring does not work, and
each character appears with a shadow.</a>
</li>
<li><a href="#bug">I'm sure I found a bug; what do I do?</a></li>
<li><a href="#ipython">Can I use IPython with Crunchy?</a></li>
</ul>

<h3 > ... we might have some answers.</h3>
<a id="secure"> </a><br/>
<h4 >Is it safe to browse a web site with Crunchy?</h4>
<p>We believe it is.  However, you may want to read 
<a href="/docs/about/magic.html">this</a> to find out more about how Crunchy actually
works, and decide for yourself what is safe, and what is not.
</p>


<a id="w3c"> </a><br/>
<h4 >Page messed up?</h4>
<p>
Unfortunately, Crunchy sometimes does not do a very good job of processing and rendering
<b>non W3C compliant</b> pages for display in the browser. If you find such a page, complain
to its creator, not to us! 
If you do find a W3C compliant page that Crunchy does not interpret properly, <em>then</em> 
let us know.  However, be aware that there are two reasons that may cause Crunchy
not to display a W3C compliant page properly:</p>
<ul>
<li>In its normal "paranoid" mode, Crunchy can filter out a lot of styling instructions
that only <em>look</em> like they may open the door to some malicious javascript code.
We make no apology for this: security trumps appearance in our books.
</li>
<li>Perhaps there is a conflict between the html/css class and id names used by
Crunchy and that of the web page it displays.</li>
</ul>

<a id="colours"> </a><br/>
<h4 >Look and Feel</h4>
<p> If you are wondering, we did obtain permission from officials of the 
Python Software Foundation (PSF) for adapting the official Python logo for Crunchy.  
In fact, someone from the PSF made it for us. 
However, this work is not endorsed officially by the PSF.
</p>


<a id="crunchy_ready"> </a><br/>
<h4 >Crunchy ready blog or tutorial?</h4>
<p>
If your blog or tutorial can be well displayed by Crunchy, 
either because it is W3C compliant or because (or especially if) you
have added special Crunchy markup (vlam), please consider adding a copy of the
image displayed on below in a prominent place on your blog or tutorial.  This images is
crunchy-python-powered.png and the original can be found in the server_root
directory of the Crunchy distribution.</p>
<img src="/images/crunchy-python-powered.png" alt="Crunchy Logo"/>

<a id="my_own_style"> </a><br/>
<h4>Why can't Crunchy leave my code styling alone?</h4>
<p>
In the past, Crunchy had an option called "no_style" which would instruct
Crunchy to not style the code, but leave in place the code of the user.  However,
consider the following possible code:
</p>
<pre title="html">
&lt;pre title="doctest no_style"&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; &lt;span style="display:none"&gt;do_nasty_stuff()&lt;/span&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; add(3, 4)
7
&lt;/pre&gt;
</pre>
<p>
In this situation, a user could try to define a simple function to satisfy the
visible doctest only to have some nasty code (hidden from view) executed.
In other instances (for example, with an editor), a nasty line could be hidden in
a long piece of code that would be perused in the styled section, but overlooked in
the textarea before being executed. Since Crunchy uses Pygments, the solution we
propose is for the tutorial writer to design a Pygments style (plugin) and have the
reader use it to view the tutorial.  Yes, it's a bit more work, but it's safer.
</p>

<a id="disappearing_cursor"> </a><br/>
<h4 >Vanishing cursor?</h4>
<p>
How dare you suggest that Crunchy could have a bug, simply because sometimes you can't see 
the cursor (caret) inside an editor.  Actually, this is a 
long standing Firefox
bug which <em>supposedly</em> is going to go away by the time Firefox 3.0 comes out.  If you
don't believe us, look at
<a title="external_link" href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=167801">this bug report</a>.  <b>Update:</b> We have not seen any sign of this bug since we started
using Firefox 3.</p>

<a id="selenium"> </a><br/>
<h4 >No syntax coloring in editor and weird shadow for each character.</h4>
<p>
A similar bug has been observed on a Mac with the Selenium IDE plugin enabled in Firefox.
Try disabling your Firefox plugins to see if one is causing that problem.  
Please report any problem you find with a given Firefox plugin to us so we can add
it to the FAQ.
</p>

<a id="bug"> </a><br/>
<h4 >You are sure that you found a bug?</h4>
<p>
That's rather presomptuous of you 
<small style="font-size:6pt">thinking that you found a bug, grumble</small>.  
The recommended way to report a bug is to enter a new "issue" at
<a title="external_link" href="http://code.google.com/p/crunchy/issues/list">this bug tracker</a>,
with a description of the steps needed to reproduce the bug, the platform (OS) you are using,
the Python version, browser, etc..
Alternatively, you can post a message at 
<a title="external_link" href="http://groups.google.com/group/crunchy-discuss">crunchy-discuss</a>.   The more details you provide, the better.
If you want to be more discrete you can write directly to 
<a href="mailto:andre.roberge@gmail.com">me</a>.
</p>

<a id="ipython"> </a><br/>
<h4 >You want to use IPython with Crunchy?</h4>
<p>
Sorry, IPython messes things up - it inserts its tentacles everywhere and prevent the other
intepreters from working properly.  This was at least the case with IPython version 0.8.1.
If you have IPython installed, you can 
<a href="/functional_tests/ipython.html">see for yourself</a>.
