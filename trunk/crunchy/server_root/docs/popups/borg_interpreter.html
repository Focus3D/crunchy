<p>Above the image <img src="/images/help.png">
is some Python code that was intended as an example by the tutorial writer.
Below the same image is the input box for the Borg Interpreter.</p>
<p>
Borg interpreters behave like typical Python interpreters.  However, one of their
defining characteristics is that all Borg interpreters that appear on the same
html page share a common environment.  This means that a variable or function
defined in one of them will be known by all the others.</p>
<p>Borg interpreters are part of a class that includes Parrots interpreters
and TypeInfoConsole</p>
<p>There are two other useful features to note.</p>
