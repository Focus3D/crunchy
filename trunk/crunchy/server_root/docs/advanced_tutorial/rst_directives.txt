 Crunchy/reStructuredText Demonstration
========================================

*For this to work, you need to have a recent version of
docutils installed.*

This file is a simple reStructuredText file.  However,
it does contain some **directives** which Crunchy can
interpret.

We start by showing two simple Python code samples,
with no special directives,
one with a simulated interactive Python session,
the other without, so that Crunchy will perform
its magic based on your preferences.

    >>> print "Python is great!"
    Python is great!

And for the other example, without a Python prompt,
Crunchy will not know what to do with as it will appear in
an html <blockquote> instead of a <pre>.

    print "Crunchy is pretty good too!"

We now move on to using embedded directives.

Interpreters
============

The following is an example of a default (borg) interpreter with linenumbers.
If you type the above text into the box, you will see
that "answer" can be defined and then printed

.. crunchy:: interpreter linenumber

   >>> answer = 42
   >>> print answer
   42

If you type 'answer' into this text box, then it will be
evaluated to 42. Try it:

.. crunchy:: interpreter

   >>> answer
   42

If, however, we make an isolated interpreter, we can see
that the variable 'answer' does not exist:

.. crunchy:: isolated linenumber

   >>> answer
   Error on line 1:
   NameError: name 'answer' is not defined

As you can see, isolated interpreters don't have access to the
same environment as the rest.

Editors
=======

Editors are spaces on the page where code can be edited and
subsequently executed. If you try clicking on the "Toggle editor"
checkbox, you will be presented with a nifty little editor. By
typing the above code into the editor and clicking "Execute",
you will see the results below:

.. crunchy:: editor

   print "Ni! Ni! Ni!"

Note that we did not write a Python prompt.


Alternatively, the editor can also extract lines of
code from a simulated interpreter session; here we choose to
number the lines of code starting at 10:

.. crunchy:: editor linenumber = 10

    >>> print "Pining for the fjords!"
    Pining for the fjords!
    >>> print "Crunchy and reStructuredText are neat together!"
    Crunchy and reStructuredText are neat together!

Alternate Python Versions
=========================

If you're feeling a little bit old school, and want to try out
Python 2.3, or if you have the bleeding edge Py3K SVN snapshot
installed, then you can test out different versions of Python
like so:

.. crunchy:: alt_py

   >>> print "Hello from the past!"
   Hello from the past!

Just enter the path to the Python executable you wish to use
and Crunchy will execute it and return the value.

DocTests
========

Crunchy can also embed DocTests within a page:

.. crunchy:: doctest linenumber


   >>> print greeting
   Hello, World!
