<div id="content">
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>There is a wealth of information to be found on the Internet, including
some fantastic programming tutorials.  When reading such tutorials, you may
be tempted to try out the code samples.  However, this means starting at
least one other application (an editor, or perhaps an Integrated Development
Environment) into which you can cut-and-paste the code samples, and perhaps
edit them before trying to run them.</p>
<p>Crunchy's original goal is to transform otherwise plain web-based Python tutorials into 
<i>amazingly exciting</i> interactive sessions without the need for a tool
other than your browser!  
In this basic tutorial,
we introduce the main interactive elements that Crunchy includes.  At the 
conclusion of this tutorial, you will be able to configure Crunchy so that
it meets your basic interactive needs when browsing tutorials located elsewhere
on the Internet.</p>
<p>We strongly suggest that you go through the entire basic Crunchy tutorial;
it should not take you very long and will likely be well worth it.</p>
