 Crunchy/reStructuredText getsource
========================================

*For this to work, you need to have a recent version of
docutils installed.*

This file is a simple reStructuredText file.  However,
it does contain some *directives* for the getsource plugin which Crunchy can
interpret.


Get Source
============

The following automatically import the module a_test_file, style it, and
adds line numbers.

.. getsource:: ../experimental/a_test_file linenumber

Now, just importing the method "bye", still adding line numbers ...
and an editor.  Note that the indentation will be such that this function
could not be executed without raising an error.

.. getsource:: ../experimental/a_test_file.Fantastic.bye linenumber editor

Finally, importing the function "a_function", with no linenumbers but with
an interpreter embedded.

.. getsource:: ../experimental/a_test_file.a_function interpreter
