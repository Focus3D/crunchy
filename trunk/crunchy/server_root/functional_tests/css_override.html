<h1>Crunchy css test</h1>
<p>A tutorial writer should be override the Crunchy css default, either by specifying some <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> instructions in the file or by linking to an external style sheet.
This file is intended to test these features.  
<p>The following code should be styled by Crunchy, with the default overriden so as to clearly stand out (the goal is not to be esthetically pleasing!): </p><ul><li>the Python keyword are in yellow on a black background; this is done by some embedded styling command in the head of this file.</li>
<li>the Python string is black on a yellow background; this is done by linking to an external style sheet.</li></ul>
</p>
<pre title="py_code">
for i in range(10):
    print i,
print "Hello World"
</pre>

<p><b>Note</b> Crunchy messes with Pygments' class names - it only allow one style per page,
and renames the css class <b>crunchy_pygments</b>.  This is to allow overriding the default
style.  Note that <b>crunchy_pygments</b> is the generic class name; there are specific
class names for keywords (k), strings (s), prompts (gp), tracebacks (tb), etc.  Just view the
source of a styled page for reference, or go to <a href="/docs/experimental/pygment_style_experiment.html">Creating a new Pygments style</a>.
