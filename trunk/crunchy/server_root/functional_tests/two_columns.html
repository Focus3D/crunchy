<h1>Two columns test</h1>
<p>This document contains a test for two column layout, based on
custom css.  This is work in progress - it does not behave as desired.</p>

<h3>Code only</h3>
<p>Python code should be only in one column, aligned left.  This is obviously not working.</p>
<pre title="py_code">
>>> print 'title = "py_code"'
>>> for i in range(10):
...     print i
...
</pre>

<h3>Interpreter</h3>
<p>Interpreter should be on the left, with code sample on the right. This is not working.</p>
<pre title="interpreter">
>>> print 'title = "interpreter"'
>>> for i in range(10):
...     print i
...
</pre>

<h3>Editor</h3>
<p>Editor should be on the left, with code sample on the right. 
This is working ... if the window is wide enough.</p>
<pre title="editor">
>>> print 'title = "editor"'
>>> for i in range(10):
...     print i
...
</pre>


<h3>Doctest</h3>
<p>Editor should be on the left, with code sample on the right.
This is working ... if the window is wide enough.</p>
<pre title="doctest">
>>> double(3)
6
>>> double(double(3))
12
</pre>
