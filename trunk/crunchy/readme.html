<h2>Just to complicate things a bit...</h2>
<p>While this is not necessary if you are the only user of Crunchy on your
computer, you may want to create a user account before you
start using Crunchy so that Crunchy can know your name.
To do so, you can double-click on
account_manager.py or type <em>python account_manager.py</em>
at a terminal window.
A typical session might go like the following:</p>
<pre>
$ python account_manager.py
>>> <em>new username</em>
Please input the home directory [or press 'enter' for default]: <em>press 'enter'</em>
Please input the password: <em>choose something simple</em>
Please input the password again: <em>follow the instruction</em> :-)
Does this user have administrative rights [y or n]? <em>choose y</em>
>>> exit
</pre>
<p>If you set up an account, we <b>strongly</b> suggest that you give this
first account administrative rights - otherwise you will not be able to
quit Crunchy from the menu.</p>
</p>When you are done:</p>
<ol>
<li>
Double click on crunchy.py, or type in <em>python crunchy.py</em>
at a terminal window.</li>
<li>Have fun!</li>
</ol>
<h3>What if it does not work?</h3>
<p>Note that Crunchy requires Python version 2.4 or newer.</p>

<p>If you experience some difficulties, please write to us.
In the meantime, you may want to try some of the following.</p>
<ul>
<li>
If Firefox does not start or open a new tab on its own, or you have a non-supported browser
that starts instead, start Firefox and copy the url displayed in the terminal that appeared
when you launched Crunchy into the address bar (that's the white rectangular box at the top
of your browser that contains stuff like <tt>http:// ...</tt>).  The url to be copied there
should be something like:<br/>
http://127.0.0.1:8002/, or http://127.0.0.1:8001/index.html, etc.
<br/>
Copy this in and press enter - Crunchy's first page should be displayed.
</li>
<li>
Do not use the "open a file" option from the Firefox menu to try and open a file; type in the
url as indicated in the previous step.
</li>
<li>If all of the above fail, do not hesitate to
<a href="mailto:andre.roberge@gmail.com"> write to us</a>.</li>
</ul>
