<div id='content'>
<p>
As Crunchy developers, our intention is to continuously add new features
to Crunchy.  In this section, we document <i>work in progress</i>.  Items
will be removed from this section, and incorporated in the other sections
when the following three conditions are met:</p>
<ul>
<li>We consider them to be "feature complete";</li>
<li>We are convinced that they add to Crunchy's usefulness;</li>
<li>They are documented for tutorial writers.</li>
</ul>
<p>We hope that, one day, Crunchy will be seen to be as including as many unexpected
useful features as Python does today.</p>
