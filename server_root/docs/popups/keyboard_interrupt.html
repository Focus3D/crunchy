<h3>The KeyboardInterrupt <img src="/images/stop.png" style="height:48px;"> </h3>
<p>
<b>IF</b> you are using Python version 2.5+, or have the ctypes module installed, 
<b>once the interpreter starts executing some of your code</b>, you will see 
this image appear.  Clicking on it will send a
<b>KeyboardInterrupt</b> to the Python interpreter.  This could be useful
if you want to interrupt some long running code.</p>
