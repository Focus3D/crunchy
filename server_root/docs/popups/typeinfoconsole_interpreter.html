<p>Above the image <img src="/images/help.png">
is some Python code that was intended as an example by the tutorial writer.
Below the same image is the input box for the Borg Interpreter.</p>

<p>
TypeInfoConsole interpreters have a somewhat unusual behaviour. 
If you just type in the name
of a known variable at the prompt, the value of that variable will be
echoed together with its type.
Like the Borg interpreters which are the default in Crunchy, they
<b>do</b> share a common environment with other interpreters on the same page.</p>

<p> The prompt <code>&lt;t&gt;&gt;&gt;</code> for the TypeInfoConsole interpreter
has a "t" in it as a reminder that the type of the variable is echoed back.
</p>

<p>There are two other useful features to note.</p>
<ul>
<li>The KeyboardInterrupt: <img src="/images/stop.png" style="height:32px;"></li>
<li>The mini editor: <img src="/images/editor.png" style="height:32px;"></li>
</ul>
