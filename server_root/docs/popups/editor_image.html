<h3>The mini editor <img src="/images/editor.png"></h3>
<p>
If you find that the code example is rather long, you can save yourself a fair bit of typing
by clicking on this image.
You should see appearing below it a larger box (an html textarea for those interested)
and a button at the bottom.  
Clicking on that button feeds the code to the interpreter.  Note that each line will
be fed to the interpreter as though you typed it in.  <b>Warning:</b> sometimes
a blank line in a code sample fed that way 
will be interpreted as ending an indented block ... and may yield some undesired result.
