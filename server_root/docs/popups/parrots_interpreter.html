<title>[dead] Parrots Interpreter</title>

<p>Above the image <img src="/images/help.png">
is some Python code that was intended as an example by the tutorial writer.
Below the same image is the input box for the Borg Interpreter.</p>
<p>
<small>[dead]</small> Parrots interpreters display a behaviour half-way between typical 
Python interpreters and code run from editors: there is no output shown unless
the user specifically <b>print</b>s the variable. So, if you just type in the name
of a known variable at the prompt, the value of that variable will <b>not</b> be
echoed.
Like the Borg interpreters which are the default in Crunchy, they
<b>do</b> share a common environment with other interpreters on the same page.</p>
<p> The prompt <code>_u__))</code> for the <small>[dead]</small> Parrots interpreter
is meant to look like two <small>[dead]</small> parrots lying on their backs, with 
two legs pointing up as well as two long beaks.

<p>There are two other useful features to note.</p>

<li>The mini editor: <img src="/images/editor.png" style="height:32px;"></li>
