<h1> Hello <span title="username">username</span>!</h1>
<p>
As a tutorial writer, you may want to greet a user by his or her
username, as we have just done above.  This is easily accomplished as follows:</p>
<pre title="html">
&lt;span title="username"&gt;Irrelevant text be replaced by the user's username.&lt;/span&gt;
</pre>
<p>That's it!</p>

<h3>This is Crunchy's version <span title="version">version</span>!</h3>
<p>
This file is so short that we might as well add, for reference, how to
insert automatically Crunchy's version number</p>
<pre title="html">
&lt;span title="version"&gt;Irrelevant text be replaced by Crunchy's version.&lt;/span&gt;
</pre>
<p>That is to say ... this will be accurate provided that we [Crunchy developers] 
have updated the value appropriately in the version.py plugin ...</p>
