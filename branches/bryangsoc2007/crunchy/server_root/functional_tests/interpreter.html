<h1>Interpreter Tests</h1>
<p>Crunchy allows embedding a number of Python interpreters in
a given html page. All the interpreters share a common environment,
which means that variables defined in one interpreter do not
have to be redefined in an other one.</p>
<p>The following is a sample interpreter session; verify that the
output is as expected:</p>
<pre title="interpreter">
>>> # simple evaluation:
>>> 7*6
42
>>> # handling spaces:
>>> 7 * 6
42
>>> # assignment:
>>> x = 7*6
>>> print x
42
>>> # tooltip; type slowly and observe the "popup tooltip"
>>> # appearing when typing "(" and disappearing with ")": 
>>> range(5)
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
>>> # auto-indent (use backspace to create the blank line at the end): 
>>> for y in range(5):
...     print y,
... 
0 1 2 3 4
</pre>

<p>Here are a few more examples (with added linenumbers):</p>
<pre title="interpreter linenumber">
>>> # undefined variable
>>> print a
Error on line 1:
 name 'a' is not defined
>>> # however, previously defined variables should be remembered
>>> print x
42
>>> #the following should not actually exit, but instead catch the error; 
>>> # the error message could be improved upon!
>>> # also note that a tooltip appears when typing "."
>>> import sys
>>> sys.exit()
Error on line 1:

</pre>

<h2>Bugs</h2>
<ul>
<li>The tooltip (mentioned above) does not work.</li>
<li><code title="py_code">sys.exit()</code> instructions are not intercepted - they effectively kill the interpreter session.</li>
<li>Auto-indent (which was implemented in the "old" Crunchy) is not working; it is not entirely clear if this is something that is really necessary since, without it, one does not need to use backspace to end a code block.
</li>
</ul>
