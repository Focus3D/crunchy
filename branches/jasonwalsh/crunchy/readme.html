<h1>Instructions</h1>
<p>Due to security concerns, you have to create an account before you
can start using Crunchy.  To do so, you can double-click on
account_manager.py or type <em>python account_manager.py</em>
at a terminal window.  A typical sesion might go like the following:</p>
<pre>
$ python account_manager.py
>>> new Username
Please input the home directory [or press 'enter' for default]: choose default
Please input the password: choose something simple
Please input the password again: follow the instruction :-)
Does this user have administrative rights [y or n]? choose y
>>> exit
</pre>
<p>We <b>strongly</b> suggest that you give this
first account administrative rights - otherwise you will not be able to
quit Crunchy from the menu.</p>
</p>When you are done:</p>
<ol>
<li>
Double click on crunchy.py, or type in <em>python crunchy.py</em>
at a terminal window.</li>
<li>Have fun!</li>
</ol>

<h3>What if it does not work?</h3>
<p>Note that Crunchy requires Python version 2.4 or newer; however, it does not work
with Python 3.x</p>
<p>Furthermore, some advanced features appear to not work properly when using
Firefox 3.  We are investigating this ... but feel free to file in a bug report
if you encounter any problem.</p>
<p>Some users have reported that the simple approach did not work on their computer.
If you experience some difficulties, please write to us.  In the meantime, you may want to try
some of the following.</p>
<ul>
<li>
If Firefox does not start or open a new tab on its own, or you have a non-supported browser
that starts instead, start Firefox and copy the url displayed in the terminal that appeared
when you launched Crunchy into the address bar (that's the white rectangular box at the top
of your browser that contains stuff like <tt>http:// ...</tt>).  The url to be copied there
should be something like:<br/>
http://127.0.0.1:8002/
<br/>
Copy this in and press enter - Crunchy's first page should be displayed.
</li>
<li>
Do not use the "open a file" option from the Firefox menu to try and open a file; type in the
url as indicated in the previous step.
</li>
<li><b>The following has not been reproduced: </b>A linux user has reported that he needed to start Firefox using sudo (i.e. in superuser mode).
Also, when he did that, Firefox did not start in its usual mode - it started with a "virgin" profile
with no bookmarks, etc.  If this happens to you <b><em>and especially if you know why and how
to prevent it</em></b>, please let us know.
</li>
<li>If all of the above fail, do not hesitate to write to us.</li>
</ul>
