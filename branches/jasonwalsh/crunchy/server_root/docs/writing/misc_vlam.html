<p>Here are a few additional options that could occasionally be of interest
to tutorial writers.</p>
<h3 >Fetching a local tutorial</h3>
<p>If one wants to insert a "browser" object to load a local tutorial,
all that is required is to write:<br/>
<code title="html">&lt;span title="load local"&gt;</code> <em>one or more spaces</em> 
<code title="html">&lt;/span&gt;</code>.  
In addition to loading the tutorial, Crunchy will also adds as the first item 
to the Python path (<code title="python">sys.path</code>)
the directory where the tutorial is located; this will allow importing
modules that are distributed with the tutorial - as long as they are in the
same directory.</p>
<h3 >Fetching a remote tutorial</h3>
<p>If one wants to insert a input box to load a remote tutorial,
all that is required is to write:<br/>
<code title="html">&lt;span title="load remote"&gt;</code> <em>optional url</em> 
<code title="html">&lt;/span&gt;</code></p>

<h4 >Adding a path to <code title="python">sys.path</code></h4>
<p>As we have mentioned, when a local tutorial is loaded via the "file browser" mentioned
above, its path is added to <code title="python">sys.path</code>.  Other relative
paths can be added via the following syntax<br/>
<code title="html">
&lt;meta title="python_import" name="<em>relative_path</em>" /&gt;
</code>
