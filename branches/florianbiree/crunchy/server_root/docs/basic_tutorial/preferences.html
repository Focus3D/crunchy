<p>Crunchy has been designed to be highly configurable by the end user.
That is you, <span title="username">your name</span>.
To see the various configuration options, you could type in <code>help(crunchy)</code> in the 
interpreter below - or in any interpreter or other Crunchy object that can be used
to execute some Python code, decipher the information provided, and figure out
which values to choose, relying on Crunchy to tell you when you make a typing mistake.</p>
<pre title="interpreter">
help(crunchy)

<h4>Automatic saving</h4>
<p> As soon as you change a value for the preferences, it is saved automatically.  However,
it is likely that you will have to view a new page, or reload the current one, 
to see the effects of your changes.
</p>
</div>

<p>Using a command line interface like this is known as the <i>power user</i> way ...</p>
<p>For those that do not feel so ... <i>powerful</i>, Crunchy provides a more pedantic
approach, described below.</p>

<h3>The Crunchy Way</h3>
<p>The information that appears in the 3 tables below is extracted directly from
the Crunchy code.  It would be pointless for me to try to describe
each of the possible options in this text written so many days before you read
this document...  Rather, I encourage you to read the information provided in
the tables, select the values you want, and go to some other page to see
the effects of your choices.</p>
<p>Some of the variables you can select have only two possible values:
<code title="python">True</code> or <code title="python">False</code>.
</p>
<div title="preferences boolean">...</div>
<p>Other variables can take different values, one chosen among many allowed ones.</p>
<div title="preferences multiple_choice">...</div>
<p>Yet, some others, are totally up to you, <span title="username">your name</span>.</p>
<div title="preferences user_defined">...</div>
