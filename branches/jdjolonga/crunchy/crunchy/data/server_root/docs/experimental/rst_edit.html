<p>The html code (live preview <em>to the right</em> the textarea)
is updated <b>each time a key is pressed</b>.
When the editor is toggled, the live preview does not occur.  However, one
can use the editor to save/load a file.

Example Title
=============

You can type any reStructuredText in here and see the html preview.  If you
toggle the editor, the live preview will stop;  however, you
can use the editor to save/load a reStructuredText file.

Here's an example of a directive:

.. image:: ../../images/crunchy.png

We also included a python file in the same directory as the one where
the original html file in which this editor is embedded is located.  So
we can use a Crunchy-specific directive to include this python file.

.. getpythonsource:: a_test_file

Or, we can be even more specific and include only one function from
the same file.

.. getpythonsource:: a_test_file.a_function
