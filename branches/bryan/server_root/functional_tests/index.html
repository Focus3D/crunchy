<h1>The Crunchy Test Suite</h1>

<p>The following is a list of links to pages that test different features of Crunchy.  
Each of these tests should be exercised before a new release is created.  
Existing bugs can (and should) be documented here as well.</p>

<h2>Normal operation</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="interpreter.html">Interpreter</a></li>
<li><a href="editor.html">Code Editor</a></li>
<li><a href="doctest.html">Doctest</a></li>
<li>i18n: to be done</li>
<li><a href="links.html">Links</a></li>
<li><a href="colourizer.html">Colourizer Test</a>
<ul><li><a href="special.html">Special characters</a></li></ul></li>
<li><a href="graphics.html">Graphics</a></li>
<li><a href="external.html">External Execution</a></li>
<li>IMPORTANT TEST: <a href="security_test.html">Javascript security test</a></li>
<li><a href="css_override.html">css override test</a></li>
<li><a href="images.html">Image tests</a></li>
<li><a href="load_tutorials.html">Loading arbitrary tutorials</a></li>

<li><a href="menus.html">Alternate menu</a> from hard link (with css from server_root)
  <ul><li><a href="menus2.html">Alternate menu</a> from browsing local tutorial (with css 
  in location relative to this file.)</li></ul></li>
<li><b>Sound:</b> The old Crunchy used to have some minimal sound support on Linux and Windows.
However, this was not suitable for any serious demonstration and the sound capabilities
are better provided by specialised libraries.</li>
<li><a href="comprehensive.html">comprehensive test</a>: meant to be used a
complete vlam reference.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Error handling</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="brokentree.html">Broken html tree</a>: The new (0.9+) version of Crunchy can now display pages with some errors in it; previously, when errors were found (such as missing closing tags) it was only displaying a blank page. Ideally, it Should display the original page with an error message (in a popup window?)  A previous version displayed a custom alert (on top of a blank page); somehow this is now broken - but is probably not the behaviour we wanted anyway.</li>
<li><a href="does_not_exist.html">Non-existent file</a>: currently displays a custom page whose appearance could be improved upon (perhaps with images, in a humourous way) and which should be translated to the default language - when the i18n features are working.</li>
<li><a href="empty.html">Empty file</a>: file with no head nor body; these will
be added by Crunchy, together with a very visible warning.
</ul>

<h2>Others</h2>
<ul>
<li>IPython is a fairly advanced replacement for the normal Python console.
Unfortunately, it messes up Crunchy rather badly when used as an alternative shell.
Assuming you have it installed on your system, you can <a href="ipython.html">try it out</a>. </li>
</ul>
