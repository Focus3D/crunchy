<h1>Welcome to the new Crunchy!</h1>

<p>
Crunchy has been re-written from the ground up (yet again!).  
This is version 0.9.1, the second release in the 0.9x series; 
the previous "stable" version was 0.8.2.
This new version has many enhancements over the previous one.
We are working steadily towards the 1.0 release.
</p>
<p>  If you are new to Crunchy, you may want
to go first through the user tutorial using the links on the left.</p>
<p>If you are want to look for Python tutorials, use the "Browsing" menu.</p>

<p>You can come back to this page by clicking on the Crunchy Python logo at the top of any page.
To quit Crunchy, simply click on the "Quit" link at the top.</p>

<h4>Look and Feel</h4>
<p> We have obtained permission from representatives of the Python Software Foundation (PSF)
for adapting the official Python logo for Crunchy.  However, this work is not endorsed officially
by the PSF and our choice of color scheme should only be seen as a sign of 
<b><em>our</em></b> enthusiastic support of the work of the PSF - not the other way around.

<p><b>Enjoy!</b></p>
