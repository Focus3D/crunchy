<h1>Welcome to the new Crunchy!</h1>
<div class="wide-warning">
<h4>Safe browsing!</h4>
<p>Crunchy is a tool that can be used to try out Python code found in html documents,
either locally or on the web.  Before you browse the net with Crunchy, make sure you
check this <a href="/functional_tests/security_test.html">security test page</a> to see if
using Crunchy with your browser avoids common security problems.</p>
<p>Even then, we can not assume responsibility for security holes: 
<b>use at your own risk.</b>  If you do find potential security risks, including
other tests to use on our test page, please let us know.</p>
<p>If you know what you are doing, you can visit external sites, by typing in the appropriate
url.  We provide a default one to get you started. </p>
<span title="load_remote">http://docs.python.org/tut/</span>
<p>Remember: before executing any Python code within Crunchy, make sure you
understand what it does.  Very simple Python programs (even a simple line of code) can
be used to delete all the files on your computer.</p>

Crunchy has been re-written from the ground up (yet again!).  
This is version 0.9.2, the third release in the 0.9x series; 
the previous "stable" version was 0.8.2.
This new version has many enhancements over the previous one.
We are working steadily towards the 1.0 release.
