<h1> Welcome to Crunchy! <img src="crunchy.png" alt="Crunchy Logo"/></h1>
<p>This is a preview version of the new Crunchy.  
Crunchy has been re-written from the ground up (yet again!).  
The previous "stable" version is 0.8.2.  
When this new version is considered "stable", it will become version 0.9
with plans for the 1.0 release soon after.  Here are some suggestions as to how
you can use Crunchy.</p>
<h3>Python interpreter</h3>
<p> The first thing you might want to try, is to use the embedded interpreter to write
the standard first program.
</p>
<pre title="interpreter">
>>> print "Hello World!"
"Hello World!"
</pre>
<h3>Officially learning Python</h3>
<p> After writing your first Python instructions, you might be interested in going through the 
<a href="http://docs.python.org/tut/tut.html">the official Python tutorial</a>
on the python.org website to learn more about Python.
</p>
<h3>Elsewhere on the planet</h3>
<p>
Perhaps you are a more advanced user, interested in browsing the latest Python blogs.  
If you do so, you might want first 
to enter <code title="py_code">crunchy.no_markup = "editor"</code> in the above interpreter prompt
before loading up the blogs and possibly trying out some sample Python code you might
find there.<p>
<span title="load_remote">http://planet.python.org</span>
<p>If the user has include some Python code inside an html <tt>&lt;pre&gt;</tt> element, Crunchy
will recognize it and make sure you can try it out.  
<em>Unfortunately, Crunchy sometimes does not do a very good job of processing and rendering
<b>non W3C compliant</b> pages for display in the browser.</em> If you find such a page, complain
to its creater, not to us! 
If you do find a W3C compliant page
that Crunchy does not interpret properly, then let us know.</p>
<h3>Closer to home</h3>
<p> What if you already have some Python tutorial (html documents) on your own computer
and you would like to use Crunchy to go through them.  You can browse and load them here.</p>
<span title="load_local"> </span>
<h3>Testing, 1, 2, testing, ...</h3>
<p>
Finally, in the absence of real documentation for Crunchy, you might want to browse 
the <a href="functional_tests">various tests</a> we include.  In doing so, if you notice a bug,
please let us know.
</p>
<p><b>Enjoy!</b></p>
