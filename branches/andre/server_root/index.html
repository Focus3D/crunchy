<p> 
This is version 0.9.8.6.
We were planning to have version 1.0 released but, since many small improvements
are added to Crunchy through various <i>tasks</i> as part of Google's
Highly Open Participation contest, we are delaying the release to incorporate
these improvements and give a better public recognition to the students
that are contributing to Crunchy.
