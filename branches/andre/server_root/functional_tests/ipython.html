<h1>IPython Test</h1>
<p><a title="external_link" href="http://ipython.scipy.org/moin/">IPython</a> is a fairly advanced replacement for the normal Python console.
Unfortunately, trying to use it as an intpreter shell messes up Crunchy rather badly.
Assuming you have it installed on your system, to see it in action, execute the following code.  </p>
<pre title="editor">
from IPython.Shell import IPShellEmbed
ipshell = IPShellEmbed(["-colors", "NoColor"])
ipshell()
</pre>
<h2>Bugs</h2>
<ul>
  <li> It works ... but messes up everything else.  Try going to a normal interpreter and entering "42" to see what happens.</li>
</ul>
