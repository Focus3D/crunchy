<h2>Bugs</h2>
<ul>
  <li>There are no known security bugs in the security model used for Crunchy. It consists of two main parts:
<ul><li> a "script stripping" function (found in security.py), which removes any pre-existing javascript and other "unsafe" commands on the html page; </li><li> a "random session id" (found in CrunchyPlugin.py) that is appended to commands (like /exec and /doctest) that enable communication between the browser and Crunchy's server.  This needs to be done as a 2nd security layer in case we have overlooked some potential unsecure javascript code.</li></ul>
