<h1>Tutorial loading tests</h1>
<p>We provide two type of forms/inputs to load remote or local tutorials.  First the remote case, which we take to be the official
Python tutorial:
<span title="load_remote">http://docs.python.org/tut/tut.html</span>  Of course, one can change the value from the default, to be any valid url.
</p>
<p>The second case is for local tutorials. Here, due to browser/javascript security reasons, we can not provide a default value.
<span title="load_local"> </span></p>

<p> This second example sort of work, but relative links are not handled as they should; it is just a hack for now.</p>
