<h1>Tutorial loading tests</h1>
<p>We provide two type of forms/inputs to load remote or local tutorials.  
First the remote case, which we take to be the official
Python tutorial:
<span title="load_remote">http://docs.python.org/tut/tut.html</span>  
Of course, one can change the value from the default, to be any valid url.
</p>
<p>The second case is for local tutorials. Here, due to browser/javascript security reasons, 
we can not provide a default value.
<span title="load_local"> </span></p>
<p>However, you may want to load the file called "test_import.html" found
in the Crunchy distribution in the server_root/functional_tests directory.</p>
<p><a href="index.html">Back to the test index</a></p>
