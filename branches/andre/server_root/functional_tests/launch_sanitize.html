<h1>Launching test for sanitize.py</h1>

<p><b>This file is only meant for Crunchy developers.</b>
</p>

<p>As of December 2007, when launching Crunchy using Python 3.0a1 or 3.0a2,
we can not deal with regular html files - since ElementSoup/BeautifulSoup
is not available for Python 3.x.  Instead, what we can do, on the assumption
that Python 2.x is the default Python version, is to launch a separate
process, using the default Python version, to use ElementSoup/BeautifulSoup
to <i>sanitize</i> the original file <i>i.e.</i> to "clean up" the html code
by closing the required tags, etc., and use the opportunity to remove the unwanted
elements.  The output file will then be suitable for processing with
Crunchy running under Python 3.0.</p>

<p>The following displays the content of sanitize.py. 
<b>NOTE:</b> upon launching this process, the content of the editor will be copied
into sanitize_new.py which will be the file that will be launched; this is to
prevent accidental modifications to sanitize.py
