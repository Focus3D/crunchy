 Crunchy/reStructuredText Demonstration
========================================

Interpreters
============

The following is an example of a borg interpreter.
If you type the above text into the box, you will see
that "answer" can be defined and then printed

.. interpreter:: interpreter
   :linenumber:

   >>> answer = 42
   >>> print answer
   42

If you type 'answer' into this text box, then it will be
evaluated to 42. Try it:

.. interpreter:: interpreter
   
   >>> answer
   42

If, however, we make an isolated interpreter, we can see
that the variable 'answer' does not exist:

.. interpreter:: isolated
   :linenumber:

   >>> answer
   Error on line 1:
   NameError: name 'answer' is not defined

As you can see, isolated interpreters don't have access to the
same environment as the rest.

Editors
=======

Editors are spaces on the page where code can be edited and
subsequently executed. If you try clicking on the "Toggle editor"
checkbox, you will be presented with a nifty little editor. By
typing the above code into the editor and clicking "Execute",
you will see the results below:

.. editor:: no-copy
   :linenumber:

   >>> print "Ni! Ni! Ni!"

Alternatively, the editor can come pre-loaded with a few lines of
code, like so:

.. editor::

    >>> print "Pining for the fjords!"


Alternate Python Versions
=========================

If you're feeling a little bit old school, and want to try out
Python 2.3, or if you have the bleeding edge Py3K SVN snapshot
installed, then you can test out different versions of Python
like so:

.. alt_py::

   >>> print "Hello from the past!"
   Hello from the past!

Just enter the path to the Python executable you wish to use
and Crunchy will execute it and return the value.

DocTests
========

Crunchy can also embed DocTests within a page:

.. doctest::
   :linenumber:

   >>> print greeting
   Hello, World!
