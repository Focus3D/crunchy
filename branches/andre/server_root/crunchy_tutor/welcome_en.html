<p>This is a tutorial on the use of Crunchy (version 0.9). Crunchy's goal is to transform plain web-based Python tutorials into <i>amazingly exciting</i> interactive sessions!</p>
<h3>What is needed to run Crunchy?</h3>
<blockquote><i> ... If I may begin at the beginning. First there is the <font color="red">cherry</font> fondue. This is extremely nasty, but we can't prosecute you for that...</i><br />
<small>From the Monty Python's Crunchy Frog sketch. </small></blockquote>
<p>Since you are reading this file, chances are that you are already using Crunchy.  If that is not the case, in addition to Crunchy you will also need:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Python.  I do mean Guido van Rossum's Python, not Monty Python nor a real life snake.  
Chances are it is already installed on your computer.</li>
<li>Firefox.  Crunchy may work (at least partially) with some other browsers, but it is currently only tested with Firefox.</li>
</ul>
<p style="font-size:xx-small;">Previous versions of Crunchy (&lt; 0.8) required the presence of effbot's Elementtree; starting with version 0.8, the required modules from Elementtree are included in Crunchy's distribution. Note that the first versions of Crunchy (&lt; 0.3) also required to have
<font color="red">CherryPy</font> installed; <span style="color:red">CherryPy</span> is a nice and easy to use app if you ever need it.</p>
<p>Since you are reading this page, it should mean that you are ready to learn more about Crunchy.
But to do so properly, you need to be using Crunchy.
I suggest that you go through the various links on the left in the order in which they appear,
starting with the <a href="interpreter_en.html">Interpreter</a></p>
<h3>Advanced stuff</h3>
<blockquote><i>
Move along.  There's nothing to see!  Keep moving!</i> <br/>
<small>From Monty Python and the Holy Grail.</small>
</blockquote>
<p>
Every page of this tutorial will include some advanced material that can and probably should
be skipped at first reading so that you don't get bored with all the details.
