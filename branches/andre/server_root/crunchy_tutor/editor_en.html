<p>Sometimes, you want to write Python code that is <i>*gasp*</i> worth saving.  In this case, rather than using the Python interpreter, you probably resort to your favourite editor which most likely allows you to run your Python code.  Start your favourite editor, and type in (or cut-and-paste) the following example, most of which has been shamelessly lifted from the official Python tutorial.</p>
<pre title="editor size=(8, 80)">
for n in range(2, 10):
    for x in range(2, n):
        if n % x == 0:
            print n, 'equals', x, '*', n/x
            break
    else:
        print n, 'is a prime number'
print a      # will raise an error
</pre>
<p>If you read this page using Crunchy and your favourite browser, you will see that a "text box" with a handy button is located just in between this paragraph and the piece of code above.  So, if you are using Crunchy, you don't need to use an editor to actually try the above <i> long</i> example. Furthermore, starting with version 0.8, you will notice a check box labeled "Toggle editor".  If you click on it, you will see appear on the page a
real editor, provided by Christophe Dolivet.  If you are interested in
this editor, search for EditArea on the Internet.</p>
<p>If you do try the example, you will notice that "errors" (output from stderr) are printed in a different colour than "normal" stuff (output from stdout).</p>
<p>If you are using Crunchy, you might want to try to type in some code in the other coding area provided just below.  
Why?  Because you can, that's why!</p>
