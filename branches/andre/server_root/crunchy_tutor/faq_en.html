<p>Crunchy does not have bugs! 
We do recognize that it does have a few interesting <em>features</em>; however, you should
not confuse those with actual <em><b>bugs</b></em>.</p>
<h3>If you do have some questions...</h3>
<ul><li>
<a href="#w3c">The external page I view with Crunchy is all messed up as compared with viewing
it directly with my browser.</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="#colours">Crunchy's logo and the choice of colours look very much like
Python's.  Can you really do this?</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="#crunchy_ready">My blog or tutorial shows up very well using Crunchy; 
should I do anything special?</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="#disappearing_cursor">The cursor (caret) sometimes does not show up in an editor or
textarea.  Surely, this is a Crunchy bug.</a>
</li>
<li><a href="#bug">I'm sure I found a bug; what do I do?</a></li>
<li><a href="#ipython">Can I use IPython with Crunchy?</a></li>
</ul>

<h3> ... we might have some answers.</h3>
<a id="w3c"> </a><br/>
<h4>Page messed up?</h4>
<p>
Unfortunately, Crunchy sometimes does not do a very good job of processing and rendering
<b>non W3C compliant</b> pages for display in the browser. If you find such a page, complain
to its creator, not to us! 
If you do find a W3C compliant page that Crunchy does not interpret properly, <em>then</em> 
let us know.</p>

<a id="colours"> </a><br/>
<h4>Look and Feel</h4>
<p> If you are wondering, we did obtain permission from officials of the 
Python Software Foundation (PSF)
for adapting the official Python logo for Crunchy.  However, this work is not endorsed officially
by the PSF and our choice of color scheme should only be seen as a sign of 
<b><em>our</em></b> enthusiastic support of the work of the PSF - not the other way around.

<h4>Crunchy ready blog or tutorial?</h4>
<p>
If your blog or tutorial can be well displayed by Crunchy, 
either because it is W3C compliant or because (or especially if) you
have added special Crunchy markup (vlam), please consider adding a copy of the
image displayed on below in a prominent place on your blog or tutorial.  This images is
crunchy-python-powered.png and the original can be found in the server_root
directory of the Crunchy distribution.</p>

<a id="disappearing_cursor"> </a><br/>
<h4>Vanishing cursor?</h4>
<p>
How dare you suggest that Crunchy could have a bug, simply because sometimes you can't see 
the cursor (caret) inside an editor.  Actually, this is a 
long standing Firefox
bug which <em>supposedly</em> is going to go away by the time Firefox 3.0 comes out.  If you
don't believe us, look at
<a title="external_link" href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=167801">this bug report</a>.  </p>

<a id="bug"> </a><br/>
<h4>You are sure that you found a bug?</h4>
<p>
That's rather presomptuous of you 
<small style="font-size:6pt">thinking that you found a bug, grumble</small>.  Ok,
since you appear to be so sure of yourself, you can go ahead and humiliate yourself
publicly by posting to 
<a title="external_link" href="http://groups.google.com/group/crunchy-discuss">crunchy-discuss</a>, with
a description of the steps needed to reproduce the bug, the platform (OS) you are using,
the Python version, browser, etc.  The more details you provide, the better.
If you want to be more discrete you can write to either

<ul>
<li>andre dot roberge at gmail dot com, <em>or</em></li>
<li>johannes dot woolard at gmail dot com</li>
</ul>

<h4>You want to use IPython with Crunchy?</h4>
<p>
Sorry, IPython messes things up - it inserts its tentacles everywhere and prevent the other
intepreters from working properly.  If you have IPython installed, you can
