<h4>Please note</h4>
<p>
While we strive to keep it up to date, this document is possibly not up to date with the latest
configuration options - whereas "config.help" is extracted directly from the
source code and, as such, should always reflect the options available.
</p></div>
<p>Crunchy has been designed to be highly configurable by the end user.  
To see the various configuration options, you can type in <code>crunchy.help</code> in the 
interpreter below - or in any interpreter or other Crunchy object that can be used
to execute some Python code.  However, to make it a bit easier to figure 
out the various options, we will describe each of them in this document.</p>
<pre title="interpreter">
&gt;&gt;&gt; crunchy.help
</pre>
<h3>Selecting the security level</h3>
<p>Before changing the security level, you should read the FAQ entry on this topic.</p>
<p>By default, the security level is set to <code>normal</code>.  You can select a
different security level as follows:
</p>
<pre title="interpreter">
&gt;&gt;&gt; # choose among 'strict', 'normal', 'trusted', 'display strict' ...
&gt;&gt;&gt; # ... 'display normal', 'display trusted'
&gt;&gt;&gt; crunchy.security = 'strict'
</pre>
<p>Remember that if you choose a security level that starts with <code>display</code>
no interactive elements will remain and, unless you have another previously open page
in a different tab or window, you will not be able to change that setting during
the current Crunchy session.</p>
<h3>Selecting the language</h3>
<p>Crunchy has been designed to be translatable so feedback to the user could be
given in languages other than English.  However, as of version 0.9.2, no 
actual translation is available except for EditArea, the
embedded source code editor.  You can try the following examples to see the language
configuration in action.</p>
<p>Our plan is to make Crunchy's configuration more complete and friendlier by
the time version 1.0 is released.</p>
<pre title="editor">
# The following will raise an error message as of version 0.9.2
crunchy.language = 'fr'

# Note that if the chosen language is available, Crunchy tries
# to also set the same language for EditArea.

# The language used by EditArea can always be set using the following.
crunchy.editarea_language = 'fr'

# When the page is created, the default values are used.
# To see the effect of the new selection, you will need to reload
# the page after executing the code, toggle the editor, and hover
# your mouse over the various editor icons.
</pre>

<h3>Changing the default interpreter</h3>
<p>The interpreter of choice for Crunchy is the "Borg" interpreter - this is the
interpreter chosen when <code>title = "interpreter"</code> is inserted inside a 
<code>pre</code> tag.  While a tutorial writer may specify any type of interpreter
to be inserted, a user can always overrule that choice - this can be particularly
useful for a teacher who might want to demonstrate certain aspects
of Python in a classroom situation.  Such an assignment is done as follows</p>
<pre title="interpreter">
&gt;&gt;&gt; crunchy.override_default_interpreter = "Borg"
</pre>
<p>If the user specifies "default", Crunchy will revert to following the
choices specified in the tutorial's vlam code.
</p>

<h3>Friendly tracebacks</h3>
<p>Crunchy makes some attempts at providing tracebacks that are a bit friendlier
than those used by Python as a default.  In doing so, we make it possible to 
express at least some parts of the tracebacks in languages other than English -
if the translations are available. To see this in action, try the
following doctest example, making sure it will not run satisfactorily (perhaps
by simply pressing the "Run doctest" button.  As a second step, change the
tracebacks used as indicated below.</p>
<pre title="doctest">
&gt;&gt;&gt; double(22)
44
</pre>

<p>To change the tracebacks used, change the value of the "friendly" parameter from 
<code title="py_code">True</code> to <code title="py_code">False</code>.</p>
<pre title="interpreter">
&gt;&gt;&gt; crunchy.friendly = False
</pre>
