<h4>Safe browsing!</h4>
<p>Crunchy is a tool that can be used to try out Python code found in html documents,
either locally or on the web.  However, we can not assume responsibility for security holes: 
<b>use at your own risk.</b>  If you do find potential security risks, please let us know.
In the meantime, and before browsing external pages, please click on the first link of
<a href="faq_en.html">FAQ, bugs, etc.</a>
to learn about security as implemented by Crunchy.  [Crunchy can not bring you to
a specific point on a new page; it always displays the page from the top.]</p>
</div>

<div class="notes">
<h4>Crunchy is paranoid</h4>
<p>
Due to security concerns, every time Crunchy loads a new <b>remote</b> site,
it will not allow any Python code to be executed from the page.  You will need
to purposely select a different security level for that site yourself if you
want to execute some Python code while broswing that site.
</p>
</div>
<h3 class="crunchy">Officially learning Python</h3>
<p> To learn about Python, it might be a good idea to through either
<a href="http://docs.python.org/tut/tut.html">the old official Python tutorial</a> or
<a href="http://docs.python.org/dev/tutorial/index.html">the NEW official Python tutorial</a>.
Either way, you will be able to find out, after going through a small security validation
step, how Crunchy can help make your learning more enjoyable.
When you choose to browse a new site, Crunchy will load it in its "display trusted" mode.
[See the <a href="faq_en.html">FAQ</a> entry on security for more details.]  In this mode,
Crunchy will only display the page, not allowing you to interact with it.  However,
you will see a link "View report" at the top.  Clicking on that link will bring a pop-up
window giving you an indication of what type of html elements (tags) were removed. 
In addition, you will be given the choice of selecting a different security mode.
For the official Python tutorial, provided it is not changed to allow users to enter comments,
we suggest that you select the 'trusted' mode.
</p>
<div class="wide-warning">
<h4>You are asking Crunchy to do <em>what?</em></h4>
<p>You should always understand any Python code you ask
Crunchy to execute.  Crunchy is just a tool that saves you the trouble of copying and pasting
code you find somewhere before trying it out on your computer.  <b>YOU</b> are responsible
for asking Python to execute some code - not Crunchy's designers.</p>
</div>

<h3 class="crunchy">Elsewhere on the planet</h3>
<p>
Perhaps you are a more advanced user, interested in browsing the latest Python blogs.  
If you do so, you might want to look at them using this:</p>
<span title="load_remote">http://planet.python.org</span>
<p>... or try any other valid url.</p>
<p>Before you do, you may want to add the site as follows:</p>
<pre title="interpreter">
>>> crunchy.add_site()
</pre>
<p>Note: if you want to browse planet.python.org, which is an aggregates of many
sites, I suggest you select 
<code title="py_code">strict</code> as the security level; no images will be shown, but
it will be totally safe.</p>
<p> You may also want to enter</p>
<pre title="py_code">
>>> crunchy.no_markup = 'interpreter'
</pre>
<p>This will insert an interpreter prompt wherever an html &lt;pre&gt; tag is encountered,
in the oft-chance that it might include some Python code that you might want to try.
However, if you are planning to browse the official Python tutorial, I suggest you
leave the current default (<code title="py_code">'python_tutorial'</code>) unchanged.</p>


<h3 class="crunchy">Closer to home</h3>
<p> What if you already have some Python tutorial (html documents) on your own computer
and you would like to use Crunchy to go through them.  You can first browse for them and then load 
them from here.</p>
<span title="load_local"> </span>

<p>If you prefer ReST you can load them as well.</p>
<span title="load_rst"> </span>

<p>Note that doing so will insert the directory where the tutorial is found in the Python
path (sys.path) so that, if any modules are distributed with that tutorial, Crunchy
will be able to import them (if they are in the same directory).</p>

<p>If you want to browse a tutorial you just downloaded from the web,
and you are not entirely sure about its safety, you may want to change
the security level of Crunchy so that it filters everything (including images)
that could possibly be used to inject malicious javascript code.
</p>
<pre title="interpreter">
&gt;&gt;&gt; crunchy.local_security = 'strict'
</pre>
