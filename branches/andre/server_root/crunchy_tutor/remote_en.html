<h3>Officially learning Python</h3>
<p> To learn about Python, it might be a good idea to through 
<a href="http://docs.python.org/tut/tut.html">the official Python tutorial</a>
on the <a href="http://www.python.org">python.org</a> website.
</p>
<div class="wide-warning">
<h4>You are asking Crunchy to do <em>what?</em></h4>
<p>You should always understand any Python code you ask
Crunchy to execute.  Crunchy is just a tool that saves you the trouble of copying and pasting
code you find somewhere before trying it out on your computer.  <b>YOU</b> are responsible
for asking Python to execute some code - not Crunchy's designers.</p>
</div>
<h3>Elsewhere on the planet</h3>
<p>
Perhaps you are a more advanced user, interested in browsing the latest Python blogs.  
If you do so, you might want to look at them using this:<p>
<span title="load_remote">http://planet.python.org</span>
<p>... or try any other valid url.</p>

<div class="wide-warning">
<h4>Safe browsing!</h4>
<p>Crunchy is a tool that can be used to try out Python code found in html documents,
either locally or on the web.  However, we can not assume responsibility for security holes: 
<b>use at your own risk.</b>  If you do find potential security risks, including
other tests to use on our 
<a href="/functional_tests/security_test.html">security test page</a>, please let us know.</p>
</div>

<h3>Closer to home</h3>
<p> What if you already have some Python tutorial (html documents) on your own computer
and you would like to use Crunchy to go through them.  You can first browse for them and then load 
them from here.</p>
