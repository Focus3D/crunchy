<h4>Safe browsing!</h4>
<p>Crunchy is a tool that can be used to try out Python code found in html documents,
either locally or on the web.  However, we can not assume responsibility for security holes: 
<b>use at your own risk.</b>  If you do find potential security risks, please let us know.
In the meantime, and before browsing external pages, please click on the first link of
<a href="faq_en.html">FAQ, bugs, etc.</a>
to learn about security as implemented by Crunchy.  [Crunchy can not bring you to
a specific point on a new page; it always displays the page from the top.]</p>
</div>

<h3 class="crunchy">Officially learning Python</h3>
<p> To learn about Python, it might be a good idea to through 
<a href="http://docs.python.org/tut/tut.html">the old official Python tutorial</a>
on the <a href="http://www.python.org">python.org</a> website.
</p>
<div class="wide-warning">
<h4>You are asking Crunchy to do <em>what?</em></h4>
<p>You should always understand any Python code you ask
Crunchy to execute.  Crunchy is just a tool that saves you the trouble of copying and pasting
code you find somewhere before trying it out on your computer.  <b>YOU</b> are responsible
for asking Python to execute some code - not Crunchy's designers.</p>
</div>

<h3 class="crunchy">Elsewhere on the planet</h3>
<p>
Perhaps you are a more advanced user, interested in browsing the latest Python blogs.  
If you do so, you might want to look at them using this:</p>
<span title="load_remote">http://planet.python.org</span>
<p>... or try any other valid url.  An interesting choice might be 
<a href="http://docs.python.org/dev/tutorial/index.html">the NEW official Python tutorial</a>;
if you select this, and trust the python site not to have been hacked on purpose to
breach Crunchy's security, make sure you set the security level to <code>trusted</code>
so that you can appreciate the new documentation style.</p>


<h3 class="crunchy">Closer to home</h3>
<p> What if you already have some Python tutorial (html documents) on your own computer
and you would like to use Crunchy to go through them.  You can first browse for them and then load 
them from here.</p>
<span title="load_local"> </span>

<p>Note that doing so will insert the directory where the tutorial is found in the Python
path (sys.path) so that, if any modules are distributed with that tutorial, Crunchy
will be able to import them (if they are in the same directory).</p>

<div class="notes">
<h4>Crunchy is paranoid</h4>
<p>
Due to security concerns, every time you start Crunchy, it is set in a fairly strict mode, 
where it is very restrictive about the html code it lets filter through to your
browser.  In particular, some style attributes and style sheets are prevented
from loading as they could hide links to some hidden javascript instructions.
</p>
</div>
<h3 class="crunchy">Advanced stuff</h3>
<p>
Because Crunchy may prevent by default many styling instructions to be
applied to web pages, their look may leave to be desired.
If you trust the web sites you are visiting to be safe, or the same for the
tutorials you might have downloaded, you might want to instruct Crunchy to be
a little bit more permissive.  You can do this by entering the 
following at an interpreter prompt.
</p>
<pre title="interpreter">
&gt;&gt;&gt; crunchy.security = 'trusted'
</pre>
<p>A good example might be <a href="http://www.python.org">python.org</a>, a site that
can most likely be trusted to be safe for Crunchy.  To see the difference between Crunchy's
paranoid mode and its more trusting one, here's what you can do:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Click on the above link to go the the python.org site.  Notice how much of the
normal styling is gone.</li>
<li>Use the browser back button to come back to this page; you will need to reload it
to have access to the interpreter.</li>
<li>Instruct Crunchy to trust the site to be safe as described above, and click on
the python.org link again- the display should be a lot more similar to what
you normally see when viewing the site with your browser.</li>
</ul>
<p>
In its normal mode, Crunchy removes any styling information that contains
the string "url(" as it can open the door to the introduction of some malicious 
javascript code.  Such styling information
can occur either as an attribute of any html tag, inside a &lt;style&gt; html element or, 
perhaps more troublesome, via any style sheet requested by a &lt;link&gt; element.
Such style sheet can in turn import other style sheets which can contain other
problematic imports, etc.   Rather than trying to figure out if the various
styling instructions are safe, Crunchy simply removes any that it finds which even look 
like it might open the door to something unsafe, i.e. if they contain the
string "url(", including those that have spaces between the "l" and the "(".</p>
<p>In addition to looking for the string "url(" in styling instructions, Crunchy also
look for any string (html entity) that starts with "&amp;#".  
There should not be any good reason to
use such encoded entities inside styling instructions.  However, there can be some
bad reasons to do so as people that try to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) have 
found out.
</p>
<p>Even when you instruct Crunchy to be less paranoid, 
it can still potentially filter out a lot
of material from the pages it loads.  Any javascript instruction or script is removed.
A number of html tag used to embed objects and initiate interactions with
users are removed as well.  Those interested may want to have a look at security.py
to see exactly what Crunchy does.
