<div id="main">
<p>I am assuming that you are viewing this page while using Crunchy.  If not, all you will see is
a somewhat traditional page with some black text in it.  Any reference to a Python interpreter
that I make will seem rather odd.</p>
<h3 class="crunchy">An almost typical introduction to Python</h3>
<p>I will not begin this introduction to Python the standard way, like it is done with all
other languages, by asking you to write the traditional</p>
<pre title="py_code">
print "Hello World!"
</pre>
<p>No, this would just be too boring and neither worthy of Python nor of Crunchy.  Instead, I suggest
that you type the following code in the interpreter prompt that appears just below it.</p>
<pre title="interpreter">
&gt;&gt;&gt; answer = 211 // 5
&gt;&gt;&gt; print answer
</pre>
<p>If you haven't made any mistake, Python will respond with <b>
The Answer to The Ultimate Question Of Life, the Universe and Everything,</b>  <small>at least according to the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.</small> 
The Python interpreter you just used was actually inspired by and adapted from some great work by Robert Brewer. You may have also 
noticed that the Python code was displayed in colour, with Python keywords in 
blue, numbers in black, operators in reddish brown, etc., quite unlike the boring all
black stuff of the original html page.</p>
<p>Impressive, isn't it?  Now try the following in this other interpreter.</p>
<pre title="interpreter">
&gt;&gt;&gt; print answer
</pre>
<p>Yes, <tt>WE ARE THE BORG</tt>.  Crunchy's Borg interpreters all share the same state so that variables entered in one of them are known to all the other
interpreters on the same page.  However, if you are in search of a bit of 
individuality, you can try the same experiment again below.</p>

<pre title="interpreter isolated">
&gt;&gt;&gt; print answer
</pre>

<div class="notes">
<h4>Different prompt</h4>
<p> Notice how the prompt of the isolated interpreter (<code class = "py_prompt">--&gt;</code>)  is different
from the standard Python prompt, used for the Borg interpreter.  The single <code class="py_prompt">&gt;</code> sign is meant as a reminder that this is an individual interpreter.
</p>
</div>

<p>Python/Crunchy gave you an error message, as it did not know the answer
to the ultimate question.  Generally, you should only see Borg type interpreters used in Crunchy.  However, you should keep in mind that there are other possibilities.</p>
<p>After seeing these amazing feats, I am convinced that you will want to purchase Crunchy!</p>
<blockquote><i> I'm not interested in your sales! I have to protect the general public!</i><br />
<small>From the Monty Python Crunchy Frog sketch.</small></blockquote>
<p>Crunchy is not for sale: it is free software.  However, it is not designed for the "general public".  Using a Python interpreter on a computer can lead to unwanted results, depending on the code that is being executed. 
[<code title="py_code">import os:</code> <span style="color:red">use with caution!</span>]  We can not be held responsible for any negative consequence of code you type in for Crunchy/Python to execute.</p>
<h3 class="crunchy">Slightly advanced stuff</h3>
<p>Yes, it's ok to read on.  I am not going to introduce really super advanced stuff here.</p>
<p>You can type in more than one line of code and interact with the interpreter in various ways.  In the examples below, I have tried to show both what you should type in, and a preview of the response from Crunchy.  First, we start
with an interaction where the interpreter will be waiting for a response to
a question.</p>
<pre title="interpreter linenumber">
&gt;&gt;&gt; name = raw_input("What is your name?")  # note: use only ascii characters
<span class="stdin">What is your name?</span>Your_name_should_appear_here
&gt;&gt;&gt; print name
Your_name_should_appear_here
</pre>
<p>Next we show examples of loops; make sure you indent the code properly.</p>
<pre title="interpreter linenumber">
&gt;&gt;&gt; for i in range(4):
...     print i
... 
0
1
2
3
</pre>

<p>
Next, try this example and notice how, at some point, a pop-up "help window" will appear at the top left.  You can make it go away by clicking on the 
<span style="font:sans-serif;">X</span> or simply keep on typing until it goes away on its own, except for the last three examples.
</p>

<pre title="interpreter">
&gt;&gt;&gt; import sys
&gt;&gt;&gt; help(sys)   # click on the X when you're finished reading
&gt;&gt;&gt; sys?        # shortcut for help.
&gt;&gt;&gt; sys.exit?
</pre>

<p>Finally, you can view the variables defined so far (I won't show you
the expected output since it depends on what <em>you</em> tried before)
using the <code title="py_code">dir()</code> function, and remove them all,
effectively starting a new session, using the <code title="py_code">restart()</code> function.
</p>
<pre title="interpreter">
&gt;&gt;&gt; dir()
&gt;&gt;&gt; restart()  # specific to Crunchy
&gt;&gt;&gt; dir()
</pre>

<p>You now know enough to use the interpreter to learn about Python following a "real" Python tutorial.  You can either do this by go to the 
<a href="http://docs.python.org/tut/tut_en.html">the official Python tutorial</a>
on the python.org site or continue to learn about Crunchy by clicking on the editor link on the left.</p>
<h3 class="crunchy">Advanced stuff</h3>
<p>Starting with version 0.9.2, Crunchy's interpreter knows some new tricks that can be very useful ... but potentially tricky.
Consider the following.</p>
<pre title="interpreter">
&gt;&gt;&gt; name = "Guido van Rossum"
&gt;&gt;&gt; print name
Guido van Rossum
</pre>
<p>Instead of having only two lines of text, imagine we had 20 lines.  To reproduce this example would require lots of typing.
Using some advanced feature of Crunchy, you can save yourself a fair bit of typing.
Here is how: click on the image <img src="../editor.png" alt="editor.png" style="height:30px"/> to the right of
the interpreter.
You should see appearing below it a larger box (an html textarea for those interested)
with two buttons at the buttom.
One button copies the code shown above (just the input - not the output) 
inside the textarea, ready for editing or just executing.  
The other button feeds the code to the interpreter. 
Try it out!
</p>
<p>While this is a neat trick, there are a couple of caveats: Crunchy takes each line as though you had typed it yourself, one line at a time, in an interactive session.</p>
<h4 class="crunchy">Caveat #1 </h4>
<p>Try to click on the image, copy code and execute trick with the following.</p>
<pre title="interpreter">
&gt;&gt;&gt; name = raw_input("Enter your name: ")
&gt;&gt;&gt; print "YOUR NAME IS", name
</pre>
<p>Now, try it again here to see more clearly what happened:</p>
<pre title="interpreter">
&gt;&gt;&gt; print "Your name is: ", name
</pre>
<p>As you should see, Crunchy had taken the second line as your answer to the first. 
This is unlikely to be what you want.</p>
<p><b>First lesson:</b> do not use <code title="py_code">input()</code> or 
<code title="py_code">raw_input()</code> inside a box obtained by clicking
on the editor image next to an interpreter.</p>

<h4 class="crunchy">Caveat #2 </h4>
<p>Try again with the following example: click on the editor image, 
copy the code and execute it.  
You will find that the interpreter will not be able to
handle the result and will effectively shut down.  Normally, you would have
to reload the page to try again; however, I will give you another copy
to work with just below.</p>
<pre title="interpreter linenumber">
&gt;&gt;&gt; def flatten(seq):
...     """flatten(sequence) -> list
... 
...     Returns a single, flat list which contains all elements retrieved
...     from the sequence and all recursively contained sub-sequences
...     (iterables).
... 
...     Examples:
...     >>> flatten([[[1,2,3]], [4,5], [6], 7, (8,9,10)])
...     [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
...     """
... 
...     result = []
...     for elem in seq:
...         if hasattr(elem, "__iter__") and not isinstance(elem, basestring):
...             result.extend(flatten(elem))
...         else:
...             result.append(elem)
...     return result
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; flatten([[[1,2,3]], [4,5], [6], 7, (8,9,10)])
</pre>
<p>The problem is due to the empty line (12).  Imagine that you were typing in the code yourself, line by line.
When you enter an empty line, the interpreter interprets this as the end of
a function definition (or a loop, or if statement, etc.).
To avoid this problem, we need to have something with no empty lines.
</p>

...

<p><b>Second lesson:</b> beware of empty lines inside a box obtained by clicking
on the editor image next to an interpreter.</p>

<h3 class="crunchy">Really advanced stuff: the <small>[dead]</small> parrot interpreter</h3>

<blockquote>
<em>
     <b>Mr. Praline:</b> ... I wish to complain about this parrot what I purchased not half an hour ago from this very boutique.<br/><br/>

     <b>Owner:</b> Oh yes, the, uh, the Norwegian Blue...What's,uh...What's wrong with it?<br/><br/>

     <b>Mr. Praline:</b> I'll tell you what's wrong with it, my lad. 'E's dead, that's what's wrong with it!<br/><br/>
     <b>Owner:</b> No, no, 'e's uh,...he's resting.<br/><br/>
</em>
<small>From Monty Python: the dead parrot sketch.</small>
</blockquote>

<p>The dead parrot sketch is a very funny, and very popular, sketch performed by Monty Python.  If you have never seen it, I encourage you to search for it on video.</p>
<p><em>What does this have to do with interpreters, you ask? </em> On the Python 
edu-sig list, Michael Tobis posted the following:</p>
<blockquote><em>
One problem I have consistently had with beginners is in explaining
the difference between how the interpreter produces output without an
explicit 'print' statement (producing the str() of the last evaluated
expression) and how python run from a file does not.<br/><br/>

This is perfectly natural and useful for an experienced user, but it
is awkward and confusing for the beginner, who has enough of a
cognitive load just trying to track all the pieces.<br/><br/>

This leads to two (well, four) questions:<br/><br/>

1) How have you folks addressed this problem in your beginning
classes? Do you find it causes difficulties?<br/><br/>

2) Would it be difficult to provide an alternative interpreter that
produced nothing unless you asked it to print? Would this be a good
idea?
</em>
</blockquote>
<p>These are very good questions that follow an insightful observation.
I will not attempt to answer them here, except to say that Crunchy addresses the third one [that is to say, the first one of the two that are
labeled as the second one] by providing not one, but two <small>[dead]</small> parrot interpreters.  These <small>[dead]</small> parrot interpreters
do not echo back what is typed into them; you need to explicitly type 
<code title="py_code">print</code> to get an output, as follows.</p>
<pre title="parrot">
>>> "'E's dead."
>>> print "He's resting."
He's resting.
</pre>
<div class="notes">
<h4>Different prompts :-)</h4>
<p> The prompt <code class = "py_prompt">_u__)</code> for the parrot interpreter
is meant to look like a <small>[dead]</small> parrot lying on its back, with its 
two legs pointing up as well as its long beak.  The <small>[dead]</small>
Parrots prompt is meant to represent many (two actually) <small>[dead]</small>
parrots, with only the beak from the second one showing, as it is hidden behind
the first.
</p>
</div>
<p>This <small>[dead]</small> parrot interpreter is unique; it behaves like an
individual interpreter encountered before.</p>
<p>There can never be enough of a good thing - at least, I think so when it
comes to Crunchy.  This is why I give you the <small>[dead]</small> Parrots 
<small>[with a capital P and an 's' at the end]</small> interpreter.</p>

<pre title="Parrots">
>>> "'E's dead."
>>> print "He's resting."
He's resting.
</pre>
<p>Like the Borg interpreter
these share all the same state.  They have been assimilated.</p>

<h3 class="crunchy">More really advanced stuff: the TypeInfoConsole</h3>
<p>As a follow-up to Michael Tobis original post on edu-sig mentioned above,
John Posner suggested:</p>
<blockquote>... if the user types an expression that
returns a value,
have IDLE echo the return value annotated with its type, and with 
"&lt;&lt;&lt;" as a
prefix. Reversing the direction of the angle brackets is a neat (IMHO) way
to remind the user of the concept of "return value".
</blockquote>
<p>While we did not quite follow to the letter John's suggestion, we have
made available the TypeInfoConsole which you can try below.</p>
<pre title="TypeInfoConsole">
>>> a = 3   # assignment does not echo anything as usual
>>> a       # try and see for yourself what happens now
>>> fun = (1, 'a', {'a':1}, (1, 2), [1, 2], set('abc'), 1.0, 1+1j)
>>> for f in fun:
...     f
...
</pre>


<h3 class="crunchy">Advanced stuff, for tutorial writers</h3>
<p>In order to instruct Crunchy to insert an interpreter below a Python code sample, one uses the <code>title</code> attribute as follows:</p>
<p><code>&lt;pre title="&lt;&lt;interpreter&gt;&gt; [no_style] [linenumber [=starting_number]]"&gt;</code><br/>
<code>Some Python code</code><br/>
<code>&lt;/pre&gt;</code></p> <p> where the square brackets
indicate optional arguments, and <code>&lt;&lt;interpreter&gt;&gt;</code> can
be any value taken from the following list:
<code>[interpreter, isolated, parrot, Parrots, TypeInfoConsole]</code>; the standard choice
should be <code>interpreter</code>.</p>

<p>
Any number of interpreter "prompts" can 
appear within a page; if <code>interpreter</code> has been selected, every
such interpreter used on the same page 
shares the same environment; if <code>isolated</code> is chosen, then
each such interpreter will have its own environment.  
Sharing the same environment means that, if you need to import a given module as you go through a tutorial, you only have to do it once; similarly, a variable defined in one such interpreter will be known to others, until the user clicks on a link to load a new page.</p>
<p>Any text between the <code>pre</code> tags is placed before the interpreter, in a <code>pre</code> element and styled. If the <code>linenumber</code>
option is present, a line number will appear before each line of input
code; the line numbering will start at 1 unless a different starting value is given.</p>
