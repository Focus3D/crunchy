<h2>Python tutorials adapted for Crunchy.</h2>
<p>As a demonstration of what Crunchy Frog can do with existing Python tutorials, here are two examples you may be familiar with.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amk.ca/python/howto/regex/">The regular expression HowTo</a>, written by A.M. Kuchling has been <a href="howto/regex.html">adapted for Crunchy.</a> </p>
<p><a href="http://wiki.python.org/moin/HowTo/Sorting">The Sorting Mini-HowTo</a>, written by Andrew Dalke has found a new home (and new look!) recently.  The original has been <a href="howto/sorting.htm">adapted for Crunchy.</a></p>

<h2>Crunchy demos</h2>
<p>The first draft of a <a href="demos/sound_tutor.html">sound tutorial</a>, 
which uses both sounds and graphics, might be worth having a look.</p>

<h2>Finding other tutorials.</h2>
<p><small>You should be able to load a local "crunchified" html file and have it work properly.

<h3> Getting out</h3>
<p><small>All the examples so far have been local ones, i.e. they are all files 
included with the standard distribution.  The following is a link to the
tutorial hosted on sourceforge.net. 
<a href="http://crunchy.sourceforge.net/src/html/index.html">Crunchy tutorial 
on sourceforge.</a> Linking to a remote tutorial this way, from a local page, 
will not produce a Crunchy tutorial.</small></p>
<p>However, loading a remote tutorial normally works by typing in the address in the handy box provided below:
<span title="load remote">http://crunchy.sourceforge.net/src/html/index.html</span></p>
