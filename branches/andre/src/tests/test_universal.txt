universal.py tests
==================

Note: this file is encoded in utf-8.

Tested successfully with Python 2.4, 2.5 and 3.0a1

universal.py contains various functions whose definitions are dependent on the
Python version being used, but provided to the user in a totally transparent way.

Testing u_print
---------------

Whereas the original Python used ascii as the default encoding,
Python 3k is using utf-8 as a default.  One of the many consequences is that
unicode strings are not specified with a prefix "u".  Thus, whereas in the
original Python, one might have written u"André", in Python 3k the same
string is simply written "André".

Furthermore, in Python 3k, "print" is now a function.   To provide a
transparent way of printing, we have defined a function called u_print()
which is meant to print a series of arguments.

    >>> import universal
    >>> if universal.python_version < 3:
    ...     to_print = "André".decode('utf-8')
    ... else: 
    ...     to_print = "André"
    >>> universal.u_print(to_print)
    André
    >>> universal.u_print("a", "b", "c")
    abc
