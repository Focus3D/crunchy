<p>
If you are designing a multi-file tutorial, such as the one you are reading,
you may want to give it a coherent style.  Rather than having to repeat all
the styling information and navigation menu (such as the one you find on the left-hand
side of this page - not the one inserted by Crunchy itself), 
you can instruct Crunchy to use another file as a
<em>template</em>.  An example is given by the very file you are reading.
Other than the title, its style should be identical to that of all
the other files about writing Crunchy tutorials you have been reading.</p>
<p>
The instruction to use a template is given in <b>this</b> file as
</p>
<pre title="html">
&lt;meta title="template ../index.html"&gt;
</pre>
<p>To be consistent with normal html documents, 
such an instruction would normally be found in the <code title="html">&lt;head&gt;</code> of the
html file, althought Crunchy would find it anywhere.
In the example above <code title="python">"../index.html"</code> 
gives the relative path of a file
that is requested to be used as the template.</p>
<p>When requesting a file to be used as a template for another file (the <em>tutorial</em>),
the following occurs as part of the normal processing by Crunchy:</p>
<ol>
<li>
The tutorial is scanned for any html <code title="html">&lt;div id="..."&gt;</code>. 
If none is found, the instruction to use a template is ignored by Crunchy.  
Otherwise, it proceeds to the next step.</li>
<li>A copy of the file requested as a template is loaded by Crunchy.  
 <ul><li>It is
strongly suggested that this template file do not include any Crunchy-specific
instruction ("vlam").
</li></ul></li>
<li>The template is parsed and the same "purging" of elements 
(such as removing javascript) is
performed on the template as it would be on a regular html file.
    <ul><li>For efficiency, the result is saved so that when the same template
    file is requested, the pre-parsed copy is used.
</li></ul>
</li>
<li>The content of the <code title="html">&lt;head&gt;</code> of the tutorial
is merged with that of the template.  This ensures that all styling information
in the template is preserved, and is augmented by any information found in
the tutorial file itself.  
    <ul><li>As an example of this, we have overriden the
styling of the title of this page to make it stand out. In particular, the
font size has been reduced to illustrate that styling instructions found
in the tutorial file take precedence over those found in the template.
</li></ul></li>
<li>Using the previously found <code title="html">&lt;div&gt;</code>s having a specific
<code title="python">id</code> attribute from the tutorial: 
if a <code title="html">&lt;div&gt;</code> with an <code title="python">id</code>
having the same value is found in the template, the content from the tutorial's
<code title="html">&lt;div&gt;</code> replaces that of the tutorial.  
    <ul><li>For example, in this file,
we have two such <code title="html">&lt;div&gt;</code>s: 
one with an <code title="python">id="main_title"</code>, 
the other with an <code title="python">id="content"</code>.</li>
<li>
The file structure (e.g., the order in which the <code title="html">&lt;div&gt;</code>s appear)
does not have to be the same for both the template and the tutorial.  The final
structure is going to be that of the template.  Thus, one only has to make changes
to a single template file to change the whole look of a multi-file tutorial.
</li></ul></li>
<li>Note that if a top level <code title="html">&lt;div&gt;</code> is found in the tutorial
file with no corresponding <code title="html">&lt;div&gt;</code> in the template file, its content
is going to be lost, i.e. it is not going to be copied into the template.
</li>

</ol>
