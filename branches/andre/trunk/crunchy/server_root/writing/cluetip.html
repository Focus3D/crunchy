<div id='content'>
<p>
Inserting popup helpers is fairly straightforward.  We make use of the 
<a href="http://plugins.learningjquery.com/cluetip/demo/" 
title="external_link">cluetip plugin</a> 
for <a href="http://jquery.com" title="external_link">jquery</a>.
</p>
<p>There are two options available for popup helpers: using information from the
<b>title</b> attribute only, or using full web pages.  An example of the first one is
given by the following html code.</p>

<pre title="html">
&lt;img 
    title="cluetip This will be the title | with some other | text added." 
    src="/images/help.png"&gt;
</pre>
<div class="notes">
<h4>You need more?</h4>
<p>If you find that you would like to have more of the jquery cluetip options
exposed through Crunchy, just let us know.
</p>
</div>
<p>with this: 
<img title="cluetip This will be the title | with some other | text added." 
src="/images/help.png"> as a live example. Note that the first "<b>|</b>" symbol
is used to separate the title from the rest of the text, while others
are equivalent to inserting new lines. For this type of popup helper the
width is set to 300px.</p>

<p>There is another way to insert popup helpers, using full html pages
that are identified by the <b>rel</b> attribute, as in the following
code.</p>
<pre title="html">
&lt;img 
    title="cluetip A title for the web page" 
    rel="/docs/popups/monty1.html" 
    src="/images/help.png"
    style="height:32px;"
&gt;
</pre>
<img title="cluetip A title for the web page" rel="/docs/popups/monty1.html" 
src="/images/help.png" style="height:32px;">

<h2>What does Crunchy uses as a clue?</h2>
<p>To identify that a popup helper is requested, Crunchy uses the fact that the
first word to appear in the <b>title</b> attribute is <b><i>cluetip</i></b>.
It removes that word from the <b>title</b> attribute and then proceeds to insert
the appropriate html and javascript code to make the whole thing work.  Note
that Crunchy can use pretty much any html element to insert a popup helper, even 
<b title="cluetip This time, it is definitely true:" rel="/docs/popups/monty1.html">
this bold text</b>.
