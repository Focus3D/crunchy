<div id='content'>

<blockquote><i>We use only the finest baby frogs, dew-picked and flown from Iraq, cleansed in the finest quality spring water, lightly killed, and then sealed in a succulent Swiss quintuple smooth treble cream milk chocolate envelope, and lovingly frosted with glucose.</i><br />
<small>From the Monty Python Crunchy Frog sketch.</small></blockquote>

<p>Crunchy only uses the finest computer language 
(<a href="http://www.python.org">Python</a>) to process html pages 
(preferably cleansed by the excellent htmlTidy program) to which eye-pleasing styling
options are added with a sprinkle of javascript for added interactivity; 
all code is carefully crafted from both sides of the Atlantic, with the goal
of transforming your reading of Python related tutorials into splendidly
entertaining interactive sessions within a Gecko based browser, thanks to the light addition of VLAM.

<p >Previous versions of Crunchy (&lt; 0.8) required the presence of effbot's Elementtree; starting with version 0.8, the required modules from Elementtree are included in Crunchy's distribution. Note that the first versions of Crunchy (&lt; 0.3) also required to have
<font color="red">CherryPy</font> installed; <span style="color:red">CherryPy</span> is a nice and easy to use app if you ever need it.</p>
<p>Furthermore, since you are reading this page, it should mean that you are ready to learn more about Crunchy.
But to do so properly, you need to be using Crunchy.
I suggest that you go through the various links on the left in the order in which they appear,
starting with the <a href="interpreter_en.html">Interpreter</a></p>
