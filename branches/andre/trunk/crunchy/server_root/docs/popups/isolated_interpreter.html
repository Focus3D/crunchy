<p>Above the image <img src="/images/help.png">
is some Python code that was intended as an example by the tutorial writer.
Below the same image is the input box for the isolated interpreter.</p>
<p>
Isolated interpreters behave like typical Python interpreters.  However, unlike
the Borg interpreters which are the default in Crunchy, they
<b>do not</b> share a common environment with other interpreters on the same page.</p>
<p> <img src="/images/stop.png" style="height:32px;"> 
<b>IF</b> you are using Python version 2.5+, or have the ctypes module installed, 
once the interpreter starts executing some of your code, you will see 
this image appear.  Clicking on it will send a
<b>KeyboardInterrupt</b> to the Python interpreter.  This could be useful
if you want to interrupt some long running code.</p>
<p>
If you find that the code example is rather long, you can save yourself a fair bit of typing.
Here is how: click on the image <img src="../images/editor.png" alt="editor.png" style="height:30px"/> to the right of
the interpreter.
You should see appearing below it a larger box (an html textarea for those interested)
a button at the bottom.  
Clicking on that button feeds the code to the interpreter.  Note that each line will
be fed to the interpreter as though you typed it in.  <b>Warning:</b> sometimes
a blank line in a code sample will be interpreted as ending an indented block ...
and may yield some undesired result.
