<div id="main_title">Creating a new Pygments style</div>
<div id='content'>
<p>The purpose of this document is to facilitate the design of styles (css classes)
to be used with Pygments [and Crunchy :-)].  For more information, see the 
<a title="external_link" href="http://pygments.org/docs/styles/">Pygments documentation</a>
about creating your own style.
</p>

<p>You can select the desired style here and reload the page to see its effect.</p>
<div title="preferences style">pygments css class</div>

<p>We start by extracting all the possible information (token types and corresponding
css classes) directly from the Pygments source (as included in the Crunchy distribution).
We have also added two columns designed to show some sample text styled by default
to have the same color for the text as for the background (either white on white, or
black on black).  If the text does not show in either (and the borders are the same
as all the others - sometime some styling is simply to add borders...), 
it means that the chosen Pygments
style has not been defined for this token type.  However, if there has been a style
defined, it will override the defaults and the sample text should be visible in at
least one of the two columns.
<p>
<div title="get_pygments_tokens">Create automatically the table</div>

<h2>Comparison with current styling for Python code</h2>
<p>The following is done in order to develop a new crunchy style for Pygments.
First, a fairly complete Python code sample styled with the usual Crunchy default.</p>
<pre title="py_code">
# some comment
'''A multi-
line comment
'''
import this
import sys

import my_module as something_else

class New(object):
    """a docstring"""
    def __init__(self, a, b=[], c={}):
        self.a = a
        self.b = b  # a comment
        return None, True, False
    
    def other(self, choice):
        """ a multi
            line
            docstring
        """
        pass

print "Hello world!"
for i in range(42):
   print i,

if a and b or c:
   do_this()
elif:
   do_that()

raise KeyboardInterrupt

if __name__ == "__main__":
   n = New(1234567890)
</pre>

<p> Now the same example styled by pygments</p>
