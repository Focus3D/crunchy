<h2>Bugs</h2>
<ul>
  <li>There are no known security bugs in the security module ... however, it is not currently fully implemented in the new Crunchy version.  Only the "script stripping" functions have been implemented.  The second part is to "randomize" the commands that enable communication between the browser and Crunchy's server.  This needs to be done as a 2nd security layer in case we have overlooked some potential unsecure javascript code.</li>
