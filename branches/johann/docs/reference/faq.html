<div class="question" id="crunchy1">What is Crunchy Frog?</div>
<div class="answer"><p><em>Crunchy Frog is an </em>HTTP Proxy Server<em>, i.e. an application that
requests html pages, processes them, and displays them inside a browser window.</em>
In more practical terms, Crunchy Frog transforms a normal looking html page 
into an interactive Python session.  Currently, it can insert any number of the following interactive objects within a single html page:
<ul>
<li>A Python interpreter.</li>
<li>A very primitive editor in which you can write some code and have it
executed by Python.</li>
<li>A special editor mode that automatically runs some pre-defined doctests on the code.</li>
<li>A simple (non-interactive) graphics interface.</li>
<li>A simple cross-platform sound API, accessible from any code executed in Crunchy.</li>
</ul>
</p></div>

<div class="question" id="vlam1">What is VLAM?</div>
<div class="answer"><p>VLAM stands for Very Little Added Markup. It is a W3C 
compliant way of encoding information in html files.  There are currently 
three different types of markup we use:
<ul>
<li><code>&lt;meta name="vlam" content="..."&gt;</code></li>
<li><code>&lt;pre title="some vlam commands"&gt;</code></li>
<li><code>&lt;span class="vlam_comment" style="display: none"&gt;</code>
</li>
</ul>
More information can be found <a href="vlam_summary.html">here.</a></p>
</div>
<br/>

<div class="question" id="vlam2">Why doesn't VLAM define its own proprietory xml attributes?</div>
<div class="answer"><p>Because we like to code webpages that show up as correct in HTML Tidy. We believe 
that VLAM should be (and is) as non-disruptive as possible to your web-coding experience.</p>
<p>Ideally we would like to expand the xhtml DTD to include some vlam attributes like this:</p>
<div class="code">&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/xhtml1-strict.dtd"
[
&lt;!ATTLIST div vlam CDATA "none"&gt;
]&gt;</div>
<p>But sadly this breaks Firefox (yes, we've filed a bug...).</p>
</div>

<div class="question" id="support1">What exactly is/is not supported on each platform?</div>
<div class="answer"><p>Most of Crunchy should work on anything that runs Python and has a modern browser! However, 
there are some features that are specific to a smaller set of platforms.</p>
<p>Sound is only supported on the following platforms:</p>
<ul>
<li>*nix: using GStreamer.</li>
<li>*nix using OSS.</li>
<li>Windows: Using the built-in winsound API.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, it should be noted that by modern browser we mean Firefox. At present Crunchy Frog is only developed and
tested on Firefox.  We have tried it with both Internet Explorer and Opera,
but it does not work. If anyone is willing to help in any way, let it be by
testing or, perhaps, by helping us figuring out how to make it work with IE or Opera (meaning: working with javascript), or testing it with some other
browsers, or writing Crunchy Frog compatible Python tutorials, please get in touch.</p>
</div>

<div class="question" id="run_external1">Can I start Crunchy with my own starting 
tutorial page?</div>
<div class="answer"><p>You can start Crunchy with any page as the starting 
point by creating a Python script containing the following two lines:</p>
<pre title="none">
import crunchy
crunchy.run("full_path/tutorial.html")
</pre>
</div>

<div class="question" id="help1">I want to help...</div>
<div class="answer"><p>...please do - there are loads of features that we would love to see implemented in Crunchy Frog, 
lots of testing that always needs doing and tutorials that need writing.</p>
<p>Please get in touch with either Andr&eacute; Roberge (andre.roberge@gmail.com) or Johannes Woolard 
(johannes.wollard@gmail.com [sic]).</p></div>
