<p>This is a tutorial on the use of <font color='green'>Crunchy</font> (version 0.7). <font color='green'>Crunchy</font>'s goal is to transform plain web-based Python tutorials into <i>amazingly exciting</i> interactive sessions!</p>
<div class="question">What is needed to run <font color='green'>Crunchy</font>?</div>
<blockquote><i> ... If I may begin at the beginning. First there is the <font color="red">cherry</font> fondue. This is extremely nasty, but we can't prosecute you for that...</i><br />
<small>From the Monty Python's Crunchy Frog sketch. <em>Note that the first versions of Crunchy also required to have
<font color="red">CherryPy</font> installed; <font color="red">CherryPy</font> is a nice and easy to use app if you ever need it.</em></small></blockquote>
<p>Since you are reading this file, chances are that Crunchy is just waiting for you, in the same directory as the one where you've found this file.  However, you will also need:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Python.  I do mean Guido van Rossum's Python, not Monty Python.  Chances are it is already installed on your computer.</li>
<li>Elementtree.  If it is not already installed on your computer, you can find it on <a href="http://effbot.org/zone/element-index.htm">effbot's site.</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Once these two essential packages are installed, you will be ready to use Crunchy. I asssume you know how to do this (<em>hint: look for crunchy.py</em>).
You will know that you have been successful if your browser window takes over and you see this very page appear, but with a much improved appearance. 
In the mean time, I suggest you read through the next few pages to see how Crunchy transforms a traditional Python tutorial into something that is so much more interesting.</p>
<blockquote><i>
Move along.  There's nothing to see!  Keep moving!</i> <span class="vlam_comment" style="display: none" >With Crunchy, there is more to be seen; this is a previously hidden comment extracted by Crunchy for your benefit.</span><br/>
<small>From Monty Python and the Holy Grail.</small>
</blockquote>
<p>To proceed from <b>within</b> Crunchy, explore the links on the left; 
I recommend you start with the <a href="interpreter.html">Interpreter</a>.  
You <b>must</b> use the preceeding link rather than the links in the menu if
you are not using Crunchy, but simply a regular browser.</p>
