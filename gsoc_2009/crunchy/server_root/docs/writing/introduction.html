<div id="main_title">Writing Tutorials: Introduction</div>
<div id="content">
<p>So you wrote a Python tutorial, either about the language or about some library (like pygame)
or module.  Congratulations, this is hard work.  If your tutorial was written in html, with
relevant Python code inside  <code title="html">&lt;pre&gt;</code> elements, then Crunchy can be used
to interact with it.  However, with just a tiny bit more work, you can make the interaction
with Crunchy much richer.</p>


<h3 >VLAM</h3>

<p>To accomplish its magic, Crunchy uses VLAM.  
<small><em>Well ... Crunchy can even do its magic without VLAM ... but not as well, 
and since you wrote a tutorial, you might as well take full advantage of Crunchy's
capabilities.</em></small> 
If you think you know what VLAM stands for, and you haven't read this tutorial before, 
I would bet that you are wrong.  
This is because VLAM is an acronym that Andr&eacute; made up.  It stands for Very Little Additional Markup.</p>

<p>Very Little Aditional Markup, or VLAM, is  essentially just an extended set of 
attributes for some common HTML tags.  Any .htm or .html file 
[<small> and even some reStructuredText files</small>]
loaded through Crunchy will have its VLAM code processed.</p>

<p>The basic idea that motivated VLAM was to make it as easy as possible to 
transform traditional web-based tutorials into Crunchy tutorials, without 
changing the way that the same tutorials appeared when viewed in a normal 
browser without Crunchy doing its magic. <small>(You may have to read the previous sentence more than once as it is admittedly too long.)</small> </p>

- Mock frog? We use no artificial preservatives or additives of any kind!</i><br />
<small>From the Monty Python Crunchy Frog sketch.</small></blockquote>

<h3>Additives?</h3>

<p>Most often, the explicit additive (VLAM) used by Crunchy will make use
of the <code title="python">title</code> attribute of a given html element
as follows:</p>
<pre title="html">
&lt;pre title="some clever stuff"&gt;
... some Python code ... 
&lt;/pre&gt;
</pre>

<p>If you are ready, you can go to the 
<a href="interactive.html">next page</a> and learn some more
about the explicit additive (vlam) used for each Crunchy interactive elements.
