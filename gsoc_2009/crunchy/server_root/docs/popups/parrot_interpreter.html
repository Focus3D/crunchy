<title>[dead] parrot interpreter</title>

<p>Above the image <img src="/images/help.png">
is some Python code that was intended as an example by the tutorial writer.
Below the same image is the input box for the <small>[dead]</small> parrot interpreter.</p>
<p>
<small>[dead]</small> parrot interpreters display a behaviour half-way between typical 
Python interpreters and code run from editors: there is no output shown unless
the user specifically <b>print</b>s the variable. So, if you just type in the name
of a known variable at the prompt, the value of that variable will <b>not</b> be
echoed. 
Unlike the Borg interpreters which are the default in Crunchy, they
<b>do not</b> share a common environment with other interpreters on the same page.</p>
<p> The prompt <code>_u__)</code> for the parrot interpreter
is meant to look like a <small>[dead]</small> parrot lying on its back, with its 
two legs pointing up as well as its long beak.
</p>
<p>There are two other useful features to note.</p>
