<title>Session Logging Tests</title>

<body>
<h1>Session Logging Tests</h1>
<p>Crunchy includes a "proof-of-concept" implementation of a session logging mechanism.
This file is to be used to test for logging option.  Input/output from
each of these is going to be written to an external file, crunchy_log.html,
located in the user's home directory.  More information about session logging can be
found near the bottom of this page.</p>
<h3>First, a sample interpreter</h3>
<pre title="interpreter log_id=(interp)">
>>> print("Borg")
Borg
</pre>
<h3>An isolated interpreter</h3>
<pre title="interpreter isolated log_id=( isol )">
>>> print("isolated")
isolated
</pre>
<h3>An editor</h3>
<pre title="editor log_id=( edit )">
>>> print("editor")
editor
</pre>
<h3>A doctest</h3>
<p>You know what to do with doctests: write the required code so that the following will work.</p>
<pre title="doctest log_id=( doc )">
>>> double(21)
42
</pre>
<p>Of course, a true session will include more than one page.  Try the
following link to <a href="logging_2.html">continue the logging test</a>.</p>


<h2>What is the purpose of logging a session?</h2>
<p>
There are many reasons why a user might want to log a Crunchy session.  For example:
</p>
<ul>
<li>A teacher might want to assign some examples to work through, perhaps some doctest examples,
and would like to have a permanent record of the students's work.</li>
<li>A teacher might want to record some examples created "live" in class so as to post them later
on the web.</li>
<li>A tutorial writer might want to develop the basis for a tutorial by recording her
work done using a Crunchy Python interpreter.  She can then later edit the (html) log file containing
the sample input and resulting output to add the textual information required to create a real tutorial.</li>
</ul>
<p>Crunchy's current logging mechanism provides the minimum features that would be required
for these types of activities.  It is, admittedly, not entirely user friendly at this point.
However, there has not been any request to improve on the current status.</p>
<p>If you think you could make use of an improved session logging feature, please feel
free to contact us with your request.  We only ask one thing:</p>
<ul>
<li>You must be willing to try out the various "prototypes" as we incrementally add
the requested features and give us reasonably detailed feedback.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please note that Crunchy is currently (version 0.9.8+) designed as a single-user application,
i.e. it is not intended to be residing on a server answering to requests from multiples users.
While we can see the usefulness of having a "Crunchy server", with individual (secure) logins
from multiple concurrent users, it is currently not a high priority
and it likely would be difficult for us to develop as we do not work in a multiple-user 
environment with a central server.   However, if this is seen as highly desirable by enough
people, we might just try and make it a priority.</p>
<p>Of course, anyone who would like to work on Crunchy as a developer is welcome to do so!</p>
