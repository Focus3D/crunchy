To create a windows release, modify AppVerName and OutputBaseFilename variables in crunchy.iss. Modify the first line in win32.bat. This should be the branch that is used for creating the installer. Run win32.bat, which creates a python executable with py2exe, moves release files to the 'win32' directory and runs the InnoSetup script.
